description: "Composer: Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky (Модест Петрович Мусоргский)\n\
  Conductor: Julian Rachlin \nConcertmaster: Adam Grüchot \n\nOverture (Prelude) to\
  \ the opera Khovanshchina \n\n\nModest Mussorgsky’s Overture to Khovanshchina opens\
  \ his unfinished opera with quiet power and deep atmosphere. The music unfolds like\
  \ dawn over the Moscow River, calm, solemn, and filled with foreboding beauty. Through\
  \ its shifting harmonies and timeless mood, Mussorgsky captures both the grandeur\
  \ and the tragedy of the past."
