description: 'When Edward Elgar wrote Enigma he deliberately gave very limited information
  about the inspiration for each variation. We know that all of them where written
  to someone, but Elgar only left the audience with initials to who these people really
  where.

  In this video you can hear the legendary conductor Leonard Slatkin tell the story
  behind each variation, based on the little information we have paired with his vivid
  imagination.
