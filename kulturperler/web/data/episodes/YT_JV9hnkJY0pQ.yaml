description: "Jean Sibelius' Second Symphony is considered a musical manifesto against\
  \ the Russian occupation of Finland and is also often referred to as the \"Symphony\
  \ of Independence\". \n\nWith its simple three-note motif, which runs organically\
  \ throughout the work and spills out in the radiant finale, it vividly represents\
  \ Sibelius's ability to create great things from minimal motivic material. Kazuki\
  \ Yamada leads the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra.\n\nJean Sibelius: Symphony No.\
  \ 2 in D major op. 43\n00:00 I. Alle"
