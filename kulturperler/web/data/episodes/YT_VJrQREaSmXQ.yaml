description: "One of the world's leading organists, Iveta Apkalna, is the soloist\
  \ in Saint-Saëns's powerful \"Organ Symphony.\" Camille Saint-Saëns said about his\
  \ third symphony: \"I gave to it everything I was capable of giving. What I have\
  \ achieved here, I will never achieve again.\" Saint-Saëns was right: the work holds\
  \ a unique position both among his music and among the symphonies of the 19th century.\n\
