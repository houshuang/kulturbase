description: "#Beethoven #Kraggerud #stringQuartet #noWar #ukraine \nOn Thursday,\
  \ a week after the invasion of Ukraine, all members of The Arctic Philharmonic Chamber\
  \ Orchestra performed with the Ukrainian flag colors pinned to our chests. \nWe\
  \ played this gripping movement by Beethoven, for all the victims of the meaningless\
  \ war, and to express all our feelings through one of the most heart wrenching movements\
  \ of music ever composed. \nEven in the midst of the f minor sorrows and despair,\
  \ Beethovens great human"
