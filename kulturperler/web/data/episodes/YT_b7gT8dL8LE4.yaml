description: Daniel Proietto, dancer and choreographer with The Norwegian National
  Ballet, has created a new version of Fokine's Dying Swan, with clear references
  to Michel Fokine's original choreography, wanting to highlight the modern elements
  already existing in Fokine's work. A small boy sings Tennyson's poem "The Dying
  Swan" -- and the child may be interpreted as a representation of Life itself, as
  a contrast to the dying swan.
