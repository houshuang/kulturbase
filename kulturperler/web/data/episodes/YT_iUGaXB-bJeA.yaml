  Since the orchestra can’t meet and play together because of the ongoing Covid-19
  pandemic, we wanted to try this way to make music. Hope you like it, and we hope
  to play together “for real” again soon!


  A special thank you to @Henning Kraggerud (artistic director) and Christian Kluxen
  (chief conductor) for joining our video!'
