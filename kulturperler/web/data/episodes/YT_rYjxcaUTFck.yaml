description: "'The musical rewards in this dramma are plentiful. There is refreshing\
  \ variety among the generous sequence of arias. Many of them are rhythmically engaging,\
  \ and Scarlatti's lively responses to textual images are affecting. Indeed, on this\
  \ showing it is surprising that the work is nowadays so little known.'\nNicholas\
  \ Anderson, BBC Music Magazine\n\nRoberta Invernizzi est sublime d’agilité et de\
  \ virtuosité en Giuditta.\nForumOpera \n\nGiuditta’s emotional distress in Act 2\
  \ is characterised compellingly "
