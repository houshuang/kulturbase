description: 'Live performance by The Arctic Philharmonic Sinfonietta, conducted by
  Tim Weiss.


  Soprano soloist: Berit Norbakken Solset

  Reading/Recitation: Åsne Sandgren


  In the work, Sun Song, the composer uses a traditional Swedish technique (no vibrato)
  originally used to call the cattle home. Combined with a more traditional use of
  the voice, the piece has strong contrasts and nuances in expression.'
