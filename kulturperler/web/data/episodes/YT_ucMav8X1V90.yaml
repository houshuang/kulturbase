description: "Live performance by Henning Kraggerud and The Arctic Philharmonic Chamber\
  \ Orchestra. \n\nHenning recorded in his Garden in rainy/snowy weather with snow\
  \ falling from the apple tree. \nBrand new Sony RX0 (violin mounted camera) lens\
  \ shielding accessories has not arrived in Norway yet, so a home made blue makeshift\
  \ one prevented the rain and snow from covering the front lens. \nHennings \"outside\
  \ violin\" was not as nicely handled...\n\nThe complete \"Four Seasons\" and four\
  \ of Kraggerud's own compositions "
