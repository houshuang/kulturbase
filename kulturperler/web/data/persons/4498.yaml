bio: 'Vincenzo Salvatore Carmelo Francesco Bellini ( bə-LEE-nee, Italian: [vinˈtʃɛntso
  salvaˈtoːre karˈmɛːlo franˈtʃesko belˈliːni] ; 3 November 1801 – 23 September 1835)
  was an Italian opera composer famed for his long, graceful melodies and evocative
  musical settings. A central figure of the bel canto era, he was admired not only
  by the public but also by many composers who were influenced by his work. His songs
  balanced florid embellishment with a deceptively simple approach to lyric setting.'
