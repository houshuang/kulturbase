bio: Pietro Mascagni (7 December 1863 – 2 August 1945) was an Italian composer primarily
  known for his operas. His 1890 masterpiece Cavalleria rusticana caused one of the
  greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the Verismo
  movement in Italian dramatic music. While it was often held that Mascagni, like
  Ruggero Leoncavallo, was a "one-opera man" who could never repeat his first success,
  L'amico Fritz and Iris have remained in the repertoire in Europe (especially Italy)
  since their premieres.
