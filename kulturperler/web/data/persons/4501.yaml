bio: Nikolai Andreyevich Rimsky-Korsakov (18 March 1844 – 21 June 1908) was a Russian
  composer, a member of the group of composers known as The Five. His best-known orchestral
  compositions—Capriccio Espagnol, the Russian Easter Festival Overture, and the symphonic
  suite Scheherazade—are staples of the classical music repertoire, along with suites
  and excerpts from some of his fifteen operas. Scheherazade is an example of his
  frequent use of fairy-tale and folk subjects.
