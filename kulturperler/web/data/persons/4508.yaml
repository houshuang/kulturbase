bio: Franz Schreker (originally Schrecker; 23 March 1878 – 21 March 1934) was an Austrian
  composer, conductor, librettist, teacher and administrator. Primarily a composer
  of operas, Schreker developed a style characterized by aesthetic plurality (a mixture
  of Romanticism, Naturalism, Symbolism, Impressionism, Expressionism and Neue Sachlichkeit),
  timbral experimentation, strategies of extended tonality and conception of total
  music theatre into the narrative of 20th-century music.
