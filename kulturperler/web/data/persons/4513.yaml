bio: Sir Henry Joseph Wood  (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor
  best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts,
  known as the Proms.  He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds
  of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially
  renamed in his honour as the "Henry Wood Promenade Concerts", although they continued
  to be generally referred to as "the Proms".
