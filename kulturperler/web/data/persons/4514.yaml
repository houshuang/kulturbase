bio: Giovanni Battista Sammartini (c. 1700 – 15 January 1775) was an Italian composer,
  violinist, organist, choirmaster and teacher. He counted Gluck among his students,
  and was highly regarded by younger composers including Johann Christian Bach. It
  has also been noted that many stylizations in Joseph Haydn's compositions are similar
  to those of Sammartini, although Haydn denied any such influence.
