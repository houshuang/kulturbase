bio: Emilie Luise Frederica Mayer (14 May 1812 – 10 April 1883) was a German Romantic
  music composer who became one of the most prolific female composers of the 19th
  century. Often called the "Female Beethoven," Mayer composed eight symphonies and
  numerous chamber works, piano sonatas, and orchestral overtures. Despite the limited
  opportunities for women in professional music during her time, she achieved wide
  recognition and public performance of her music across Germany.
