bio: 'Arrigo Boito (Italian: [arˈriːɡo ˈbɔito]; born Enrico Giuseppe Giovanni Boito;
  24 February 1842 –  10 June 1918) was an Italian librettist, composer, poet and
  critic whose only completed opera was Mefistofele. Among the operas for which he
  wrote the libretti are Giuseppe Verdi''s monumental last two operas Otello and Falstaff

  the prominent representatives of the Scapigliatura (Italian bohemian) artistic movement.'
