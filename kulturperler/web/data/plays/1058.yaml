synopsis: Czech composer Josef Suk's Second Symphony, named "Asrael", was completed
  in 1906 following the deaths first of his father-in-law, in 1904, and then of his
  wife. Inevitably mournful but also vital in nature, the five-movement, hour-long
  work is cast in C minor and scored in Straussian vein for large orchestra. It was
  published as Opus 27.
