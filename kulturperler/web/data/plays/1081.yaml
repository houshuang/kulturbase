synopsis: '"God Save the King" is the de facto national anthem of the United Kingdom.
  It is one of the two national anthems of New Zealand and the royal anthem of the
  Isle of Man, Australia, Canada and some other Commonwealth realms. The author of
  the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but an attribution to the
  composer John Bull has sometimes been made..'
