synopsis: A sinfonia concertante is an orchestral work, normally in several movements,
  in which one or more solo instruments contrast with the full orchestra. It emerged
  as a musical form during the Classical period of Western music from the Baroque
  concerto grosso. Sinfonia concertante encompasses the symphony and the concerto
  genres, a concerto in that soloists are on prominent display, and a symphony in
  that the soloists are nonetheless discernibly a part of the total ensemble and not
  preeminent.
