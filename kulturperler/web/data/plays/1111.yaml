synopsis: 'A Child of Our Time is a secular oratorio by the British composer Michael
  Tippett, who also wrote the libretto. Composed between 1939 and 1941, it was first
  performed at the Adelphi Theatre, London, on 19 March 1944. The work was inspired
  by events that profoundly affected Tippett: the assassination of a German diplomat
  by a young Jewish refugee in 1938, and the Nazi government''s reaction to the assassination
  which was in the form of a violent pogrom against Germany''s Jewish population:
  Kristallnacht.'
