synopsis: A piano concerto, a type of concerto, is a solo composition in the classical
  music genre which is composed for piano accompanied by an orchestra or other large
  ensemble. Piano concertos are typically virtuosic showpieces which require an advanced

  including sheet music for the pianist, orchestral parts, and a full score for the
  conductor.
