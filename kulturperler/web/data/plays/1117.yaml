synopsis: The Rite of Spring is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian
  composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's
  Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky with stage
  designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed at the Théâtre des
  Champs-Élysées on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography
  caused a sensation.
