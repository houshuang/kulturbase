synopsis: Music for the Requiem Mass is any music that accompanies the Requiem, or
  Mass for the Dead, in the Catholic Church. This church service has inspired hundreds
  of compositions, including settings by Victoria, Mozart, Berlioz, Verdi, Fauré,
  Dvořák, Duruflé and Britten. For centuries settings of the Mass for the Dead were
  to be chanted in liturgical service monophonically.
