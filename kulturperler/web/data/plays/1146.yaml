synopsis: Bolero is a Spanish dance in 3/4 time popular in the late 18th and early
  19th centuries. It originated from the seguidilla sometime between 1750 and 1772,
  and it became very popular in Madrid, La Mancha, Andalusia and Murcia in the 1780s.
  Bolero was performed as a solo or partner dance with a moderately slow tempo, accompanied
  by guitar and castanets, and with lyrics in the form of the seguidilla.
