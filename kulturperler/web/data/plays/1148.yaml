synopsis: The Mass in B minor, BWV 232, is an extended setting of the Mass ordinary
  by Johann Sebastian Bach. The composition was completed in 1749, the year before
  Bach's death, and was to a large extent based on earlier work, such as a Sanctus
  Bach had composed in 1724. Sections that were specifically composed to complete
  the Mass in the late 1740s include the "Et incarnatus est" part of the Credo.
