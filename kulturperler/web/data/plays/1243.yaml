synopsis: A ballade refers to a one-movement instrumental piece with lyrical and dramatic
  narrative qualities reminiscent of such a song setting, especially a piano ballade.
  In 19th century romantic music, a piano ballade is a genre of solo piano pieces
  written in a balletic narrative style, often with lyrical elements interspersed.
  Emerging in the Romantic era, it became a medium for composers to explore dramatic
  and expressive storytelling through complex, lyrical themes and virtuosic techniques.
