synopsis: The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale
  choral works in the classical concert repertoire. As it requires huge instrumental
  and vocal forces it is frequently called the "Symphony of a Thousand", although
  the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and Mahler
  greatly disapproved of the name.
