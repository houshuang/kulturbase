synopsis: The Hungarian composer György Ligeti composed a cycle of 18 études for solo
  piano between 1985 and 2001. They are considered one of the major creative achievements
  of his last decades, and one of the most significant sets of piano studies of the
  20th century, combining virtuoso technical problems with expressive content, following
  in the line of the études of Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, Claude Debussy, and Alexander
  Scriabin but addressing new technical ideas as a compendium of the concepts Ligeti
  had worked out in his other works since the 1950s. Pianist Jeremy Denk wrote that
  they "are a crowning achievement of his career and of the piano literature; though
  still new, they are already classics."..
