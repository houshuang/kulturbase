synopsis: 'Gypsy: A Musical Fable is a musical with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by
  Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Arthur Laurents. It is loosely based on the 1957
  memoirs of striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee, and focuses on her mother, Rose, whose
  name has become synonymous with "the ultimate show business mother." It follows
  the dreams and efforts of Rose to raise two daughters to perform onstage and casts
  an affectionate eye on the hardships of show business life. The character of Louise
  is based on Lee, and the character of June is based on Lee''s sister, the actress
  June Havoc..'
