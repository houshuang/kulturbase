synopsis: '

  "Flow, my tears" is a lute song by the accomplished lutenist and composer John Dowland
  (1563–1626). Originally composed as an instrumental under the name "Lachrimae pavane"
  in 1596, it is Dowland''s most famous ayre, and became his signature song, literally
  as well as metaphorically: he would occasionally sign his name "Jo: dolandi de Lachrimae"..'
