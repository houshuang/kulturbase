synopsis: The Carnival of the Animals is a humorous musical suite of 14 movements,
  including "The Swan", by the French composer Camille Saint-Saëns. About 25 minutes
  long, it was written for private performance by two pianos and chamber ensemble;
  Saint-Saëns prohibited public performance of the work during his lifetime, feeling
  that its frivolity would damage his standing as a serious composer. The suite was
  published in 1922, the year after his death.
