synopsis: Les Indes galantes is a ballet héroïque, a type of French Baroque opera-ballet,
  by Jean-Philippe Rameau with a libretto by Louis Fuzelier. In its final form it
  comprised an allegorical prologue and four entrées, or acts, each set in an exotic
  place, the whole being unified around the theme of love. The work dates from 1735
  except for the last entrée, which was added the following year.
