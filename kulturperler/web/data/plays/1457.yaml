synopsis: The Messa da Requiem is a musical setting of the Catholic funeral mass (Requiem)
  for four soloists, double choir and orchestra by Giuseppe Verdi. It was composed
  in memory of Alessandro Manzoni, whom Verdi admired, and is therefore also referred
  to as the Manzoni Requiem. The first performance, at the San Marco church in Milan
  on 22 May 1874, conducted by the composer, marked the first anniversary of Manzoni's
  death.
