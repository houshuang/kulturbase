synopsis: The Faust Overture is a concert overture by German composer Richard Wagner.
  Originally composed between 1839 and 1840, Wagner intended it to be the first movement
  of a Faust Symphony based on the Faust legend and play by German playwright Johann
  Wolfgang von Goethe. Eventually, Wagner abandoned writing the planned symphony and
  composed instead a single-movement concert overture, incorporating ideas from the
  other sketched movements.
