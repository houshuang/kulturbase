synopsis: Gurre-Lieder is a tripartite oratorio followed by a melodramatic epilogue
  for five vocal soloists, narrator, three choruses, and grand orchestra. The work,
  which is based on an early song cycle for soprano, tenor and piano, was composed
  by the then-Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg from 1900 to 1903. After a break,
  he resumed orchestration in 1910 and completed it in November 1911.
