synopsis: Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D 759, commonly known as the
  Unfinished Symphony, is a musical composition that Schubert started in 1822 but
  left with only two movements—though he lived for another six years. A scherzo, nearly
  completed in piano score but with only two pages orchestrated, also survives..
