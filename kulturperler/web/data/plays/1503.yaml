synopsis: Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen is a song cycle by Gustav Mahler on his
  own texts. The cycle of four lieder for medium voice was written around 1884–1885
  in the wake of Mahler's unhappy love for soprano Johanna Richter, whom he met as
  the conductor of the opera house in Kassel, Germany, and orchestrated and revised
  in the 1890s..
