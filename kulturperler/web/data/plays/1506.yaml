synopsis: Une éducation manquée is an opérette in one act and nine scenes by Emmanuel
  Chabrier. The French libretto is by Eugène Leterrier and Albert Vanloo. Composed
  in 1878–79, the work, which is set in the 18th century, is in a lively, light operetta
  style in which Chabrier excelled and had perfected in L’étoile a year or so earlier.
