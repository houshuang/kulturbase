synopsis: Ludwig van Beethoven's Concerto for Violin, Cello, and Piano in C major,
  Op. 56, commonly known as the Triple Concerto, was composed from 1803 to 1804, or
  beyond, and published in 1807 by Breitkopf & Härtel. The choice of the three solo
  instruments effectively makes this a concerto for piano trio, and it is the only
  concerto Beethoven ever completed for more than one solo instrument, also being
  the only concerto he wrote for cello.
