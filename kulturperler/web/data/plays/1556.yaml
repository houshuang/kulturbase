synopsis: Pines of Rome, P 141, is a tone poem in four movements for orchestra completed
  in 1924 by the Italian composer Ottorino Respighi. It is the second of his three
  tone poems about Rome, following Fontane di Roma (1916) and preceding Feste Romane
  (1928). Each movement depicts a setting in the city with pine trees, specifically
  those in the Villa Borghese gardens, near a catacomb, on the Janiculum Hill, and
  along the Appian Way.
