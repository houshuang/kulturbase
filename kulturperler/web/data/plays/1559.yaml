synopsis: Maurice Ravel's Piano Concerto in G major was composed between 1929 and
  1931. The piano concerto is in three movements, with a total playing time of a little
  over 20 minutes. Ravel said that in this piece he was not aiming to be profound
  but to entertain, in the manner of Mozart and Saint-Saëns.
