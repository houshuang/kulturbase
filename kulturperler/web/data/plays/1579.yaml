synopsis: The Four Seasons is a group of four violin concerti by Italian composer
  Antonio Vivaldi, each of which gives musical expression to a season of the year.
  These were composed around 1718–1723, when Vivaldi was the court chapel master in
  Mantua. They were published in 1725 in Amsterdam in what was at the time the Dutch
  Republic, together with eight additional concerti, as Il cimento dell'armonia e
  dell'inventione..
