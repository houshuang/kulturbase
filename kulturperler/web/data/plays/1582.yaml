synopsis: 'The Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas, also known as the Estaciones Porteñas or
  The Four Seasons of Buenos Aires, are a set of four tango compositions written by
  Astor Piazzolla, which were originally conceived and treated as different compositions
  rather than one suite, although Piazzolla performed them together from time to time.
  The pieces were scored for his quintet of violin (viola), piano, electric guitar,
  double bass and bandoneón. By giving the adjective porteño, referring to those born
  in Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital city, Piazzolla gives an impression of the
  four seasons in Buenos Aires.

  The order of performance Piazzolla gave to his "Estaciones Porteñas" is: Otoño (Autumn),
  Invierno (Winter), Primavera (Spring), Verano (Summer).'
