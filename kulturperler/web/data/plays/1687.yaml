synopsis: The Greeting Prelude is an orchestral work composed in 1955 by Igor Stravinsky.
  Its origins can be traced back to an incident that occurred during a rehearsal at
  the inaugural Aspen Festival in 1950, when Stravinsky was displeased by a surprise
  rendition of "Happy Birthday to You", a song with which he was unfamiliar. The next
  year, at the request of Samuel Barber, he harmonized it and composed a two-part
  canon as a birthday present for Mary Louise Curtis.
