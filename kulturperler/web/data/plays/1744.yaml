synopsis: Franz Schubert's final chamber work, the String Quintet in C major is sometimes
  called the "Cello Quintet" because it is scored for a standard string quartet plus
  an extra cello instead of the extra viola which is more usual in conventional string
  quintets. It was composed in 1828 and completed just two months before the composer's
  death. The first public performance of the piece did not occur until 1850, and publication
  occurred three years later in 1853.
