synopsis: The Symphony No. 5 by Gustav Mahler was composed in 1901 and 1902, mostly
  during the summer months at Mahler's holiday cottage at Maiernigg. Among its most
  distinctive features are the trumpet solo that opens the work with a rhythmic motif
  similar to the opening of Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No.
