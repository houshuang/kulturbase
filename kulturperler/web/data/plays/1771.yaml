synopsis: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 1 in B♭ major, K. 207, once
  was supposed to have been composed in 1775, along with his other four violin concertos.
  However, analysis of handwriting and the manuscript paper on which the concerto
  was written suggest that the date of composition might have been 1773, specifically
  with a completion date of April 1773.
