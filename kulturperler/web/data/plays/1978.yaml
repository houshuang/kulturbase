synopsis: The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a symphonic poem by the French composer Paul
  Dukas, completed in 1897. Subtitled "Scherzo after a ballad by Goethe", the piece
  was based on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 1797 poem named "Der Zauberlehrling".
  By far the most performed and recorded of Dukas' works, its notable appearance in
  the Walt Disney 1940 animated film Fantasia has led to the piece becoming widely
  known to audiences outside the classical concert hall.
