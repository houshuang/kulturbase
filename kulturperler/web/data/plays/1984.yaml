synopsis: The Violin Concerto No. 3 in G major, K. 216, was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus
  Mozart in Salzburg in 1775 when he was 19 years old. In a letter to his father,
  Mozart called it the "Straßburg-Concert". Researchers believe this epithet comes
  from the motive in the third movement's Allegretto in the central section, a local
  dance that already had appeared as a musette-imitating tune in a symphony by Carl
  Ditters von Dittersdorf..
