synopsis: The four orchestral suites BWV 1066–1069 are four suites by Johann Sebastian
  Bach from the years 1724–1731. The name ouverture refers only in part to the opening
  movement in the style of the French overture, in which a majestic opening section
  in relatively slow dotted-note rhythm in duple meter is followed by a fast fugal
  section, then rounded off with a short recapitulation of the opening music. More
  broadly, the term was used in Baroque Germany for a suite of dance-pieces in French
  Baroque style preceded by such an ouverture.
