synopsis: '"Air on the G String", also known as "Air for G String" and "Celebrated
  Air", is August Wilhelmj''s 1871 arrangement of the second movement of Johann Sebastian
  Bach''s Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068. The arrangement differs from
  the original in that it is transposed down into C major so the part of the first
  violins can be played entirely on the violin''s lowest string, which gave the piece
  its popular title..'
