synopsis: '

  Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten is a short canon in A minor, written in 1977
  by the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, for string orchestra and bell. The work is an
  early example of Pärt''s tintinnabuli style, which he based on his reactions to
  early chant music. Its appeal is often ascribed to its relative simplicity; a single
  melodic motif dominates and it both begins and ends with scored silence.'
