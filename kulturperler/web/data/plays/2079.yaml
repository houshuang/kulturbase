synopsis: Leoš Janáček's String Quartet No. 1, called "The Kreutzer Sonata", was written
  quickly between 13 and 28 October 1923 at a time of great creative concentration,
  and then revised, in the autograph, from 30 October to 7 November 1923. It was inspired
  by Leo Tolstoy's novella The Kreutzer Sonata, which had itself been inspired by
  Beethoven's Violin Sonata No.
