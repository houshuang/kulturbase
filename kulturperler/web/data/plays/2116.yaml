synopsis: The Piano Quintet in E♭ major, Op. 44, by Robert Schumann was composed in
  1842 and received its first public performance the following year. Noted for its
  "extroverted, exuberant" character, Schumann's piano quintet is considered one of
  his finest compositions and a major work of nineteenth-century chamber music.
