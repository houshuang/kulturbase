synopsis: The cantatas composed by Johann Sebastian Bach, known as Bach cantatas,
  are a body of work consisting of over 200 surviving independent works, and at least
  several dozen that are considered lost. As far as known, Bach's earliest cantatas
  date from 1707, the year he moved to Mühlhausen, although he may have begun composing
  them at his previous post in Arnstadt. Most of Bach's church cantatas date from
  his first years as Thomaskantor and director of church music in Leipzig, a position
  which he took up in 1723..
