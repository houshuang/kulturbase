synopsis: '



  The Sinking of the Titanic is a work by British minimalist composer Gavin Bryars.
  Inspired by the story that the band on the RMS Titanic continued to perform as the
  ship sank in 1912, it imagines how the music performed by the band would reverberate
  through the water some time after they ceased performing. Composed between 1969
  and 1972, the work is now considered one of the classics of British classical experimental
  music..'
