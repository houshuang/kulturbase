synopsis: Amadeus is a 1984 American period drama film directed by Miloš Forman. Peter
  Shaffer adapted it from his 1979 stage play, inspired by Alexander Pushkin's 1830
  play Mozart and Salieri. Shaffer described it as a "fantasia on [a real-life] theme",
  as it imagines a rivalry between two 18th-century Vienna composers, Wolfgang Amadeus
  Mozart and Antonio Salieri.
