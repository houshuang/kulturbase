synopsis: Káťa Kabanová is an opera in three acts, with music by Leoš Janáček to a
  libretto by the composer based on The Storm, a play by Alexander Ostrovsky, translated
  by Vincenc Červinka. The opera was also largely inspired by Janáček's love for Kamila
  Stösslová. Although he was 67 when it was premiered, Káťa Kabanová is a clear response
  to Janáček's feelings for Kamila, and the work is dedicated to her.
