synopsis: Carmen Suite is a one-act ballet created in 1967 by Cuban choreographer
  Alberto Alonso to music by Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin for his wife, prima
  ballerina assoluta Maya Plisetskaya. The premiere took place on 20 April 1967 at
  the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow. The music, taken from Bizet's opera Carmen and arranged
  for strings and percussion, is not a 19th-century pastiche but rather "a creative
  meeting of the minds," as Shchedrin put it, with Bizet's melodies reclothed in a
  variety of fresh instrumental colors, set to new rhythms and often phrased with
  a great deal of sly wit.
