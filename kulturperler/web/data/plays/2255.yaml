synopsis: Alcina is a 1735 opera by George Frideric Handel. Handel used the libretto
  of L'isola di Alcina, a work set to music in 1728 in Rome by Riccardo Broschi, which
  he had acquired a year later during his travels in Italy. Partly altered for better
  conformity, the story was originally taken from Ludovico Ariosto's epic poem Orlando
  furioso.
