synopsis: La fanciulla del West is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an
  Italian libretto by Guelfo Civinini and Carlo Zangarini, based on the 1905 play
  The Girl of the Golden West by the American author David Belasco. Fanciulla followed
  Madama Butterfly, which was also based on a Belasco play. The opera has fewer of
  the show-stopping highlights that characterize Puccini's other works, but is admired
  for its impressive orchestration and for a score that is more melodically integrated
  than is typical of his previous work.
