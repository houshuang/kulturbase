synopsis: Peter Grimes, Op. 33, is an opera in three acts by Benjamin Britten, with
  a libretto by Montagu Slater based on the section "Peter Grimes", in George Crabbe's
  long narrative poem The Borough. The "borough" of the opera is a fictional small
  town that bears some resemblance to Crabbe's – and later Britten's – home of Aldeburgh,
  Suffolk, on England's east coast..
