synopsis: The organ concertos of Johann Sebastian Bach are solo works for organ, transcribed
  and reworked from instrumental concertos originally composed by Antonio Vivaldi
  and the musically talented Prince Johann Ernst of Saxe-Weimar. While there is no
  doubt about the authenticity of BWV 592–596, the sixth concerto BWV 597 is now probably
  considered to be spurious. Composed during Bach's second period at the court in
  Weimar (1708–1717), the concertos can be dated more precisely to 1713–1714..
