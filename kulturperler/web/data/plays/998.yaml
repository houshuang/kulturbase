synopsis: The Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 61, was written by Ludwig van Beethoven
  in 1806. Its first performance by Franz Clement was unsuccessful and for some decades
  the work languished in obscurity, until revived in 1844 by the then 12-year-old
  violinist Joseph Joachim with the orchestra of the London Philharmonic Society conducted
  by Felix Mendelssohn.
