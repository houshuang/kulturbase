      "description": "This “Yesterday’s Newsreel” 1950s TV show (episode 40) offers the viewer “television highlights of the news of yesteryear” by providing vintage clips of famous people and events from the first half of the 20th century. The film begins with “1901-1949: A New World Power,” an overview of the rise of broadcast radio. At Rocky Point, New York ( 00:37 ) in 1933, Guglielmo Marconi—inventor of the radio—and David Sarnoff—American radio and television pioneer and protégé of Marconi—visit the birthplace of America’s radio broadcasting. In 1921 on WHN, the young movie star Miriam Battista ( 00:54 ) sings for listeners. Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover ( 01:24 ) uses radio in 1922. At the WJZ studio, Andrew White ( 01:38 ) updates listeners with the latest in sports. The rapid growth leads to larger, more powerful radio towers, such as the Port Jefferson tower ( 01:48 ) and the Darlington, Virginia tower ( 01:52 ) measuring over 600 feet. In 1923, the first American overseas broadcast is relayed all over England by Captain West of the BBC ( 02:00 ). One of America’s top radio studios is at Chicago’s Edgewater Beach Hotel ( 02:13 ), where members of Chicago’s Civic Opera sing ( 02:27 ) for nationwide audiences. Radio broadcasting brings operatic soprano Florence Macbeth ( 02:33 ) and tenor Angelo Minghetti ( 02:37 ) into American homes. In 1926, Marion Talley ( 02:43 ), opera coloratura soprano, sings in a New York City studio and is heard by 16 million listeners. At the Edgewater Beach Hotel’s glamorous Marine Room ( 02:55 ), the famed Oriole Orchestra ( 03:03 ) is broadcast live in one of radio’s first remote events. The rise of radio goes beyond entertainment: police departments use radio ( 03:07 ) to broadcast orders to officers on patrol. A mounted policeman receives his orders by radio ( 03:25 ). In 1923, Graham McNamee ( 03:37 ) calls the World Series ( 03:35 ) between the New York Yankees and the New York Giants. During the 1920s, radio is incorporated into airplanes and airports. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ( 04:07 ) uses radio broadcasts to deliver messages directly to the American public. The next segment, “1929: Just ‘Plane’ Dancing” ( 04:55 ), shows dancers in Paris dance their way onto a plane ( 05:00 ), where they continue dancing after takeoff to a live band ( 05:18 ). The “1923: Personalities” segment features etiquette writer Emily Post ( 05:39 ) returning from Europe; banker and philanthropist George F. Baker ( 05:48 ) stands beside her. Western actors Will Rogers and Tom Mix ( 05:58 ) practice their lassoing, with Tom appearing to give Will a lesson. Actress Alice Brady ( 06:13 ), who successfully transitioned from silent films to “talkies,” demonstrates how to apply makeup. In the “1928: Oil Goes Up In Smoke” ( 06:30 ) segment, viewers see footage of burning oil derricks ( 06:37 ) at Santa Fe Springs, California. Firemen can do little to put out the flames. It takes three days to bring the inferno under control. In “1931: Miracle of Faith” ( 07:23 ), viewers are treated to the end of the pilgrimage to Lourdes, France. At the Basilica of the Rosary ( 07:29 ), Catholic priests bless the sick ( 07:50 ), and injured men and women wait to bathe in the grotto’s healing waters ( 08:09 ). “1930: Fashions of the Day” ( 08:24 ) presents a fashion show in East Hampton, New York ( 08:30 ), where women debut ermine coats and bridal dresses. The second-to-last segment, “1930: Aviation” ( 09:09 ), shows Spanish autogyro inventor Juan de la Cierva ( 09:12 ) visiting the White House where an American version of his gyrocopter makes an expert landing on the White House lawn ( 09:40 ). President Herbert Hoover ( 09:56 ) presents an award. The final segment, “1920: Sports” ( 10:24 ), features a yacht race and two events from the 1936 Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The 1920 America’s Cup race in New York Harbor ( 10:33 ) pits Sir Thomas Lipton’s ( 10:38 ) Shamrock IV against the Americans’ Resolute, owned by Henry Walters. After losing the first two races in the best-of-five series, U.S. skipper Charles Francis Adams III leads the Resolute to a narrow win ( 10:55 ). At the 1936 Olympics, Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie ( 11:10 ) wins her third consecutive Olympic championship. On 6 February 1936, during Group B play in the first round of Men’s Ice Hockey, the U.S. team (wearing dark uniforms) takes on the German national team ( 11:31 ), and a single American goal ( 11:58 ) is enough to defeat Germany 1-0.

      "description": "Heidi Arnesen is a Norwegian filmmaker that directed the 1991 short Dual of the Senses , the first queer Norwegian short. She would later do 7 more shorts throughout the 90s. Her most recent short Night Ride  was nominated for an Oscar. In 1997, she would make her first & only feature with Some Prefer Cake . The film combines the world of stand-up and lgbt themes in the backdrop of San Francisco in the late 90s. It was written by Jeannie Kahaney, who also co-directed the movie; according to the film's credit.  Local SF comics appeared in the film, which includes: Julia Jackson, Doug Holsclaw, Mimi Gonzalez, Pola Mazursky & Aundre the Wonderwoman (offscreen voice). They have written and performed their materials in the movie except for Pola Mazursky, who plays a wacky character in the story. Local clubs were utilized in the film, such as Josie's Cabaret and Juice Joint & the Coco Club, which closed its doors in 1999 and 2000. Most of the actors in the film are local SF performers, with the only known actor being Desi del Valle ( Mod Fuck Explosion , Costa Brava ) playing Robin, the love interest for the main character Kira. However, the standout in the movie is Machiko Saito, who plays Katie; a needy stalker who goes after the main character and her friends. Machiko Saito is an interesting individual she's a filmmaker who directed 3 short films ( Premenstrual Spotting , 15 Minutes of Femme & Pink Eye ) and created a TV show called Femme TV . Pink Eye is the only one available, while the other two and Femme TV are considered lost media. She is also a photographer, costume designer, make-up artist, acting workshop leader, educator of drug and alcohol recovery, tutor, and teacher's assistant. It seems she's done it all lol. She may or may not be transgender, at least according to the Transgender Media Portal. But given that she doesn't have any online presence and not too much information about her, outside her work; it's all speculation. The film debuted in 1997 at the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival & a year later in 1998 at the New York Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. What happened to the cast & crew after the movie: -Heidi Arnesen went on to be a director for the Norwegian soap opera Hotel Cæsar  directing more than 140 episodes & would later start producing in the mid-2010s. -Jeannie Kahaney is a director at The New School in New York. -Kathleen Fontaine is a part of the San Francisco sketch comedy group Nude Coffee . She would do multiple one-person shows: Learning To Stay & Kathleen Fontaine: The Man, The Mystery! In 2017, Kathleen Fontaine transitioned to Quinn Fontaine and wrote a memoir documenting his new life as a transguy. -Desi del Valle left her position as a distribution director for Frameline in 2004 to focus on her career. She and Tara Howley collaborated again in the film Nightfall (2001), now considered lost media. She has attended various events for Columbia University (her alma mater), but it is unclear if she works for the Columbia Alumni Association or something else. -Machiko Saito appeared in a play called Contagion  in 2001. She would later be a program director, editor, and publisher for Roaddawgz, a drop-in center for homeless youth who are struggling writers, artists, and musicians. Is it unknown if Roaddawgz still operates or not? -Leon Acord created and starred in his show Old Dogs & New Tricks  with Fontaine being one of the producers. -Pola Mazursky goes by Pola Mazur these days so as not to be confused with Paul Mazursky. -Mimi Gonzalez is friends with Jessica Kirson, and they sure look alike!

      "description": "\"Axel Ejnar Hakon Børresen (June 2, 1876, Copenhagen – October 6, 1954, Copenhagen) was one of the foremost Danish composers of the 20th century. Work: Den Kongelige Gæst / The royal guest, opera in one act, first performance 15 November 1919, Royal Danish Theatre, Copenhagen. Libretto: Svend Leopold, based on a story by Henrik Pontoppidan. Ane: Edith Guillaume Arnold Höyer: Stig Fogh Andersen Servant: Lise-Lotte Nielsen Emmy: Tina Kiberg Guest: Guido Paevatalu Orchestra: Odense Symphony Orchestra Conductor: Tamás Vetö Synopsis: The story plays out an evening in a doctor's home on the Jutland peninsula around 1900. Dr. Høyer and his wife are expecting guests for a dress ball. However, all the guests decline at the last moment, and Dr. Høyer is irritated, but slightly relieved. Instead, the family receives a surprise visitor, the unknown gentleman Prince Carnival, who acts in a free and easy manner, playing the piano, talking with Dr. Hoyer's wife, and suggesting to the couple to carry on with the party.\" ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGHBhP_Sp7I&t=4s ) 2004 ------ \"Hakon Børresen 1876-1954 Hakon Børresen was to be one of the last Danish romantics. He had his break-through as a young man around the year 1900, and throughout his life he persevered in the attitudes to art and music that he had learned in his youth. He lived until 1954, and outlived almost all his like-minded Danish colleagues. In the course of his career Børresen did not write an overwhelming amount of music. Besides two operas, his major works are the three symphonies (1901, 1907, 1926), a violin concerto (1904, later performed by Arthur Nikisch, the greatest conductor of the age), a few excellent chamber works (including a sextet and two quartets) and a variety of ballet and stage music. Some of his lieder became very popular in their day, but it was in the opera The Royal Guest from 1919, more than any other work, that he found his element. Børresen was born in Copenhagen in 1876. His paternal grandfather was Norwegian, and at the end of the nineteenth century Copenhagen was still the city to which Norwegians came to carve out a career. The leading Norwegian musician in Copen-hagen in Børresen's time was the composer and conductor Johan Svendsen, who from 1883 until his death in 1911 was conductor of the Royal Danish Orchestra. He did not take on pupils, but at the age of 19 Børresen looked him up anyway for advice on whether his talent was sufficient for a career in music. Bringing with him his opus 1, the national-romantic orchestral piece Thor rides to Jotunheim, he seems to have -kindled a hope in the childless Svendsen of a successor. Svendsen had himself stalled in his composing career and took Børresen as his pupil. They developed what was almost a father-son relationship, and Svendsen remained Børresen's mentor for the rest of his life. Although Hakon Børresen was 11 years younger than his epoch-making colleague Carl Nielsen, he was more conservative, and besides his teacher he admired names like Gade, Grieg, Lange-Müller - and Wagner. Børresen's loyalty to the old world was so great that he would rather stop composing than give in to the musical developments of the period. From the mid-1920s on he wrote only about one piece a year, and after 1940 hardly anything. On the other hand he had a great influence on musical life. He was a powerful and authoritarian chairman of the Danish composers' society Dansk Tonekunstnerforening, and functioned as a kind of unofficial government consultant in musical matters. Later he became chairman of the National Musical Council, and in organizational matters he was the country's leading composer. An unpleasant but necessary palace revolution in the Danish Composers' Society in 1948 marked his sudden and sad farewell to Danish musical life. The aristocratic Hakon Børresen had a large apartment in the heart of Copenhagen and socialized with the Royal Family. But he spent his summers in Skagen in North Jutland, where Scandinavian artists had formed a colony as early as Børresen's childhood. Life in Skagen was also something Børresen persisted in as a framework for his artistic life. By the time of his death in 1954 he was an anachronism, yet he still remained a figure of dignity, kindness and great substance. The Royal Guest The Royal Guest is a little fable about how art and love can transform people and change their lives. The main characters are a married couple who are visited in their quiet, static home by a mysterious, effusive guest. With his message of joie de vivre and love he breathes new life into the couple he visits. The opera is based on a short story from 1908 by the great Danish author and Nobel Laureate Henrik Pontoppidan (1857-1943). Oddly enough the story also involves another great Danish author, Holger Drachmann (1846-1908). This requires some explanation, and the composer himself gave it when the opera was performed for the fiftieth time in 1942 at the Royal Opera in Copenhagen. In an interview he told the story behind the origin of the opera: Along with Henrik Pontoppidan I had attended Holger Drachmann's funeral in Skagen, and afterwards Pontoppidan said to me: 'Don't you know the little short story I wrote for a periodical called 'The Royal Guest'? That would be well suited to musical treatment, I think, and it should be no secret that the guest I was thinking of was Drachmann, his Renaissance personality and his marvellous poetry and beauty, which have become something shared by everyone. He has truly become a royal guest in all Danish homes!' Børresen considered the original story 'a fine subject for musical treatment - particularly inspiring when one had been under the influence of Drachmann's personality at festive artists' gatherings, or perhaps most of all in a narrow circle of friends [....] In all the homes into which Drachmann brought art and poetry, life became richer to live, but also more restless.' Whereas Pontoppidan was the realist, the thinker and the connaisseur of souls, Drachmann was the man of energy, the many-minded talent, the lover. Holger Drachmann's oeuvre was very large and versatile, including everything from popular musical productions to poems, novels and plays. He was even an able painter. His great gestures, his beard and hats and his self-dramatization as a ladies' man with many mistresses were all familiar to the public. In the decades after his death his collected works of many thousand pages were published in large printings. Since then his stock as an artist has been in decline, but if one looks at his popularity around the turn of the last century he is one of the most striking representatives of the period. Composers including Heise, Horneman, Grieg, Carl Nielsen and Lange-Müller all set his texts to music. During World War I Børresen was writing his first opera, Kaddara, which is set in Greenland. Børresen even went to Greenland to study life and song there, and the opera ended up as a huge, luxurious affair. When it was finished Børresen was given the rather strange information that the Royal Opera would have liked to stage Kaddara, but because of the war they did not have the coal reserves for such a lavish piece. 'Could you not instead write a small, short opera that we can put on together with a couple of ballets? We have just about had enough of the Italian operas I pagliacci and Cavalleria rusticana, which we normally use for this purpose,' said the director of the Opera, Johannes Nielsen. 'So the thought of The Royal Guest occurred to me, and I asked Pontoppidan if he would write the libretto, but he couldn't,' said Børresen. 'An opera libretto,' said Pontoppidan, 'that would be oh, woe and kiss and bliss - no, I'm no good at that.' By roundabout paths Børresen arrived at the versatile author and journalist Svend Leopold (1874-1942). 'He came up to see me in Skagen, where he wrote his excellent libretto in less than a fortnight, and I know that Pontoppidan was extremely satisfied with it,' Børresen reminisced in 2. At the Royal Opera the production was premiered with Poul Wiedemann as Dr Arnold Høyer, Tenna Kraft as Mrs Emmy Høyer and Arnold Høeberg as the Guest. The first performance on 15 November 1919 was conducted by Georg Høeberg, the brother of Arnold Høeberg, and one of Børresen's closest friends. For decades the opera was performed with the same cast, and quite incredibly Poul Wiedemann sang the role for 45 years (!), a total of 134 times, for the last time in 1964. After Poul Wiedemann's farewell performance The Royal Guest disappeared from the Danish opera repertoire, but the opera is still at the top of the list of the most frequently performed Danish operas ever. The Prelude to The Royal Guest also became a popular concert piece, and even at the end of the twentieth century, when the popularity of Børresen's music was at its lowest ebb, it was still a piece he was remembered for. Among the admirers of the Prelude to the opera was the King of Denmark, Frederik IX (1899-1972), who was an able conductor. He regularly attended performances of the opera with a score in front of him, and he had the Prelude in his repertoire (a recording with the King and the Danish National Symphony Orchestra / DR has been released on Dacapo 8.224158-59). In 1927, when the opera was to be performed in Stockholm, the King was even invited to conduct the production - and thus himself to be a 'Royal Guest' - but he modestly said no to the task. The Royal Guest is often spoken of as a 'conversation opera'. The roles are sung in a relaxed parlando, and there are no arias, although moments of emotion rise into more fully elaborated song lines, for example when the Guest describes his home ('I come from the castle east of the setting sun'). Hakon Børresen was in fact not a great melodist either, but for the chamber-play-like libretto he found a musical style that functioned perfectly for him. On the other hand it is very clear that he was a brilliant orchestrator. The many changes of mood and surprises in the action gave him the opportunity to really play with the instrumentation. Among his inventive devices are the way the orchestra includes the sound of the parlour piano (and a quotation from Schubert). Not least, the Guest's quirky, uninhibited flow of ideas is portrayed in the orchestral writing with great wit. The Prelude presents a number of motifs from the opera, most clearly the Guest's magnanimous arrival motif. This is a true 'festive polonaise' of the kind Børresen had learned to write from Johan Svendsen. Other themes in the Prelude are the Guest's above-mentioned arioso motif and a wistful passage for the woodwinds describing Emmy's thoughtfulness when the Guest has gone. Synopsis Scene One The action takes place in a quiet doctor's home in a remote part of Jutland around the year 1900. Doctor Arnold Høyer and his wife Emmy have been married for a few years and their relations have settled into a calm rut. They rarely have guests, and one day is like another. It is Shrovetide - a time of festivity and pranks - and the family is expecting visits from Copenhagen. Emmy and the old maid Ane are tidying up the home when at short notice the house receives the news that the guests are unable to come. Arnold is at first irritated, but then becomes quite content that his everyday life will not be disturbed. Scene Two In the evening sleigh bells are heard outside, and an unknown man appears as a guest. Høyer tries discreetly to ask about his identity, but the guest asks to remain anonymous. 'Call me Prince Carnival!' he says. Dr. Høyer goes along with the joke, and welcomes the stranger into his home. The Guest talks incessantly, is enigmatic but charming, sociable and to Emmy's delight also musical. To Arnold and Emmy's great surprise he asks that the three of them celebrate together dressed in their finest clothes. The Guest has decided he wants to arouse the spirit, wit and beauty he glimpses in them beneath the conventional surface. Scene Three At first Emmy refuses to follow the Guest's plan, but Arnold has gradually been infected by the fun. They withdraw to change into their finery. Scene Four The Guest too has changed into festive garb, and hastens to rearrange the whole parlour with flowers, candles and fruit while Arnold and Emmy are dressing. When they enter the parlour again, somewhat bewildered, they are overwhelmed to see their home transformed. The Guest designates Emmy Queen of the Feast, and they sit down at the table. Scene Five The Guest is an exuberant party companion who flirts with Emmy and in cryptic language describes his life among the mythological creatures of love. Arnold gradually becomes rapturous, partly from the wine and partly over his wife, who is in the silk dress of her youth. The party develops into a tribute to Eros, and the Guest crowns Emmy with roses in her hair. Suddenly Arnold feels the Guest has crossed the line. The Guest hastily gets up and takes his leave as abruptly as he came. On the doorstep he urges them one last time to let joy and magic into their life. Scene Six The disappearance of the Guest is a rude awakening for Arnold. At once he becomes his old buttoned-up self, and jealously scolds his wife for permitting the flirting. There is a confrontation between the couple, but they make it up, and admit that they have learned something from the evening. The disturbance of their everyday life has opened their eyes to important sides of life, and they choose to seize the opportunity to let the life-giving excitement in. Like a couple who have just fallen in love, they go arm in arm into the bedroom, while the maid stands gaping at what the Guest has done to her master and mistress. In his libretto Svend Leopold stays loyal to the characterization and chronology of Pontoppidan's story, but chooses to tie a cute ribbon around the tale by allowing the couple's disagreement to be resolved by love. In Pontoppidan's original, however, the evening ends in bitter jealousy, and the last half of the story deals with the highly problematical after-effects of the visit. The restlessness and the rich emotional life that the Guest brings into the home are very much a two-edged sword. But in Børresen's interpretation the positive effects are by far the strongest.

      "description": "-The Background music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIGyPwOGNH4 -Gustav I, born Gustav Eriksson of the Vasa noble family and later known as Gustav Vasa (12 May 1496 – 29 September 1560), was King of Sweden from 1523 until his death in 1560, previously self-recognised Protector of the Realm (Riksföreståndare) from 1521, during the ongoing Swedish War of Liberation against King Christian II of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Gustav rose to lead the rebel movement following the Stockholm Bloodbath, where his father was executed. Gustav's election as king on 6 June 1523 and his triumphant entry into Stockholm eleven days later marked Sweden's final secession from the Kalmar Union. As king, Gustav proved an energetic administrator with a ruthless streak not inferior to his predecessor's, brutally suppressing subsequent uprisings (three in Dalarna – which had once been the first region to support his claim to the throne – one in Västergötland, and one in Småland). He worked to raise taxes and bring about a Reformation in Sweden, replacing the prerogatives of local landowners, noblemen and clergy with centrally appointed governors and bishops. His 37-year rule, which was the longest of an adult Swedish king to that date (subsequently passed by Gustav V and Carl XVI Gustav) saw a complete break with not only the Danish - Norwegian supremacy but also the Roman Catholic Church, whose assets were nationalised, with the Lutheran Church of Sweden established under his personal control. He became the first truly autocratic native Swedish sovereign and was a skilled bureaucrat and propagandist, with tales of his largely fictitious adventures during the liberation struggle still widespread to this day. In 1544, he abolished Medieval Sweden's elective monarchy and replaced it with a hereditary monarchy under the House of Vasa, which held the Swedish throne until 1654. Three of his sons, Eric XIV, John III and Charles IX, held the kingship at different points. Gustav I has subsequently been labelled the founder of modern Sweden, and the \"father of the nation\". Gustav liked to compare himself to Moses, whom he believed to have also liberated his people and established a sovereign state. As a person, Gustav was known for ruthless methods and a bad temper, but also a fondness for music and had a certain sly wit and ability to outmaneuver and annihilate his opponents. He founded one of the oldest orchestras of the world, Kungliga Hovkapellet (Royal Court Orchestra); thus Royal housekeeping accounts from 1526 mention twelve musicians including wind players and a timpanist but no string players. Today Kungliga Hovkapellet is the orchestra of the Royal Swedish Opera.",

      "description": "Peter Arne Jöback (born 4 June 1971 in Stockholm, Sweden) is a Swedish singer, actor and musical artist. Peter Jöback got his big break through his collaboration with ABBA's Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson. In their musical Kristina från Duvemåla (The Emigrants) at Malmö Opera and Music Theatre, Jöback created the role of Robert and his theme song, “Guldet blev till sand”, broke every record in the Swedish charts. The musical was seen by over one million Swedes and the original cast CD-box became a triple-platinum album and received several Swedish Grammy awards. Jöback received his first Golden Mask for his role as Robert. In 1997 Peter Jöback released the album \"Personliga Val\" which reached number two on the Swedish album chart. [3] It featured 11 pop-oriented interpretations of songs from famous musicals. Cameron Mackintosh discovered Peter Jöback’s talent and offered him the lead as Chris in Miss Saigon at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London’s West End in 1997. Three years later at the same theatre, Jöback created the role of Michael in Macintosh’s original production of The Witches of Eastwick. In September 2000 Peter Jöback released Only When I Breath which was his first album in English. The album reached number one on the Swedish album charts. [4] His many stage performances and albums have been met with critical acclaim.[citation needed] Jöback’s Christmas album was released in 2002. On this album Jöback teamed up with Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø in a duet of the Irish folk song “Be thou my vision” in a Swedish translation titled \"Gå Inte Förbi\". The duo have since been frequent guests at each other’s concerts. In 2004 Jöback collaborated with Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra conducted by Nick Davies in a project called Storybook where he performed classic songs in brand new arrangements. GSO and Jöback released a CD which became a Gold Disc and also performed two concerts in the Globe Arena and Scandinavium Arena in Sweden. The album also brought Jöback to a superstar status in Norway. His first solo tour there in 2005 was a success both with audience and media.",

      "description": "The Piksels and Lines Orchestra is an experimental performance system for graphic design. The image industry populates our visual culture, yet it exists in a world with an inner life that is invisible to most people. The orchestra shifts the focus from the end results to the actions and decisions that take place during the creative process. By turning the tools of graphic design, the software applications, into instruments, the active labour and the operational gestures of designers are converted to sound. Actions like painting, cutting, setting text, adding layers, drawing shapes etc. are reflected by sonic events within a score. At the same time, the system brings the audience visually into the everyday work environment of the designer by exposing the application interfaces as they are used. In order to make the necessary software modifications, the applications used in this project are all free and open source software. The end goal is to produce a noise opera, combining elements of traditional narratives with computer music which illustrates and interrogates the technical and social systems that operate within the microcosm of graphic design. The Piksel and Lines Orchestra is the response to an open call for an artist and one developer to work together to explore the performative and collaboritve aspects of free open source graphical software. The commissioned work is carried out by media artist Brendan Howell and software developer Jon Nordby, initiated by a residency supported by Piksel and USF AIR. A technical demonstration of the system will be presented at the Piksel [X] festival on the 24th November 2012. The final performance will be given at the LGRU Future Tools conference in Madrid April 2013. The project is hosted by Piksel as part of the EU-funded LGRU-project, and is supported by USF AIR, Bergen City Council and The Norwegian Art Council. http://www.piksel.no/pulse/plo",

Pesnya o Sovetskoj Armii) or Invincible and Legendary (Несокрушимая и легендарная) or known recently as Song of the Russian Army (Russian: Песня о Российской Армии, tr. Pesnya o Rossiskoj Armii) is a famous World War II song written and performed at the war's end. Its performance was done by numerous artists, including the Alexandrov Ensemble. The original 1945 is highly triumphal with its brass fanfares and ecstatic chords extended upward with the aid of trumpets, as part of the V-E Day celebrations. That arrangement by A. Alexandrov is very much in the tradition of final choruses in 19th-century Italian grand opera, and shows how he originally envisaged this composition. There are many versions of the song. This song also serves as the official song of the Russian Armed Forces today. ●▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ❤️🤍💚RUSSIAN❤️🤍💚ஜ▬▬▬▬▬● «Несокрушимая и легендарная» — советская песня, созданная в годы Великой Отечественной войны композитором Александром Александровым на слова Осипа Колычева; также называется «Песня о Советской армии». Была создана к 25-летнему юбилею Красной армии[1] и впервые прозвучала с киноэкрана в феврале 1943 года в фильме-концерте, снятом по заданию Советского правительства к 25-летию Красной армии режиссёрами С. Герасимовым, М. Калатозовым и Е. Дзиганом. Исполнялась многими певцами и музыкальными коллективами. Была записана на грампластинках Апрелевским заводом. Ею открывались выпуски советской телевизионной передачи «Служу Советскому Союзу». Песня является визитной карточкой Академического дважды Краснознамённого, ордена Красной Звезды ансамбля песни и пляски Российской Армии имени А. В. Александрова, который традиционно открывает ей все свои выступления. ●▬▬▬▬▬ஜ❤️❤️❤️CREDITS❤️❤️❤️ஜ▬▬▬▬▬● This video was made in collaboration with Szegedi Attila, \"Damimani\" and David Cseperkáló, who kindly helped me with the lyrics of the video.

Be a part of the wild ride! The Unstoppable Balloon: How a Canadian Balloon Evaded Three Air Forces and Caused Chaos Across the Atlantic! In 1998, a massive Canadian balloon measuring the length of five football fields caused a stir as it evaded the air forces of three countries. The helium-filled balloon was launched with the mission of measuring ozone levels in the atmosphere, but things did not go as planned. After the balloon's instruments failed to detach at the end of the test, a backup system also failed, pushing the balloon even higher into the air. As a result, Canadian CF-18 fighter jets were deployed to shoot it down, but over 1,000 rounds were fired at it to no avail. The balloon continued its journey across the North Atlantic, entering British airspace and forcing air traffic controllers to redirect transatlantic flights. The balloon was eventually spotted in Norwegian and Russian airspace before crashing in Finland over a week after the start of its chaotic journey. Although it may have survived the fighter jets' bullets, the shots likely caused it to gradually lose altitude. #CanadianBalloon #AirForceChase #HighAltitudeAdventures German Ballet Director Formally Apologizes For Smearing Feces In Critic’s Face In a shocking incident, a German ballet director, Martin Goecke, was suspended from his post after he smeared dog feces on the face of a newspaper critic, Wiebke Huester, whose reviews he did not appreciate. While Goecke issued a public apology for his actions, he also expressed his frustration with the media and Huester for what he called \"often nasty reviews.\" The incident has sparked outrage and calls for accountability and zero-tolerance for violence and abuse. This serves as a reminder that in the age of social media and instant feedback, it is important to remember the power of words and actions and their impact. The cultural sector should strive for constructive criticism and open dialogue rather than resorting to violence and smear campaigns. #ZeroToleranceForAbuse #ConstructiveCriticism #AccountabilityInArts Are the Ultra-Rich Actually Less Intelligent? New Study Challenges Common Beliefs Are the ultra-rich really smarter than the rest of us? A recent study published in the European Sociological Review challenges this belief, suggesting that intelligence may play little part in achieving ultimate monetary success. The study of almost 60,000 men found a strong correlation between intelligence and wages until earnings exceeded €60,000 a year. Beyond this point, the correlation between intelligence and earnings became almost negligible. The study also found that those in the top 1 percent may actually be less intelligent than those just below them in terms of income. While the study has its limitations, it suggests the need for a more nuanced understanding of success and the factors that contribute to it. If you're looking for real intellectual role models, it may be wise to look beyond money as a guide. #intelligence #wealth #success References: https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1956160/ballon-canadien-meteo-1998-grande-bretagne-finlande?depuisRecherche=true https://www.huffpost.com/entry/martin-goecke-smeared-feces_n_63ec06ebe4b0063ccb291466 https://www.iflscience.com/the-ultra-rich-may-actually-be-less-intelligent-than-lower-paid-people-study-finds-67416 #PiperBlush #WTPR #Show #Daily #Radio #TheUnpredicatableRadio #ForTheBoldListener Bonjour, this is Piper Blush, and I'm everywhere.

The lecture is open to the public without charge.\\r \\r Helen and Hard was founded in 1996 in Stavanger on the west coast of Norway by architects Siv Helene Stangeland and Reinhard Kropf. Today, the company has a youthful staff of 18 drawn from different countries. The firm works with a wide spectrum of projects from interior, design, art and architecture to town planning.\\r \\r Helen and Hard's work attempts to creatively engage with sustainability, moving away from a solely technical or anthropocentric view towards a synergistic mode, which allows for an extended confluence not only with humans but also with contextual and material resources. Far from passive ingredients, they have a space-generating capacity as active participants in the design process. This requires a communicative engagement and synergistic collaboration with particular, local and global resources and knowledge fields. During the design process, they are synthesized in between empirical and experimental sequences, and woven together into architecture.\\r \\r Helen and Hard's work explores the heterogenic nature of relational space, not as a post-modern narrative collage, but as a fine weave, a field of interrelated sensitive elements, responding to its surrounding environment. This evocative and interwoven space expresses to the user potentiality for interaction and sharpening of all senses. The endeavor is to create meeting spaces accommodating both shared social and individual meditative encounter.\\r \\r Siv Helene Stangeland was born in Stavanger, Norway. She studied at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design and at the School of Architecture of Barcelona, Spain. She has taught at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology at Trondheim, at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, and at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Reinhard Kropf was born in Austria and studied at the Austria University of Technology in Graz and the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. He has taught at the Ecole Speciale díArchitecture in Paris and at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design.\\r \\r The firm has received many awards and honors, including the Norwegian National Award for Good Building and Environmental Design for the Pulpit Rock Mountain Lodge in Norway, nomination as an up and coming architect in Wallpaperis 10-Year Jubilee issue, second prize for the Norwegian Pavilion among all Category 2 Pavilions at Expo Shanghai, and selection as one of eight European firms exhibited in îNew Trends of Architectureî, Tokyo, 2008. The firm also won first prize in the following competitions: Cultural House and Library in Venessla, 2009; Norwegian Pavilion, Expo Shanghai, 2008; Experience Center at Floien, Bergen, 2007; Cultural House at Flekkefjord, 2007; and New Hotel at Pulpit Rock, 2005. The firm's work has been exhibited at the Lisbon Triennale, Lisbon, 2010; Building Blocks, Stockholm, 2010; Nordic Models + Common Ground, New York City, 2010; 1:1 Architects Build Small Spaces, V&A, London, 2010, Nordic Landscapes, Shanghai, 2010; Venezia Biennale, Italy, 2008 and 2010; and New Trends in Architecture, Tokyo, Perth, Istanbul, 2008-2010.\\r \\r The Victor L. Regnier Visiting Faculty Chair in Architecture at Kansas State University, funded by the Victor and Helen Regnier Family Foundation of Mission, Kansas, was established in 2003 through the extraordinary generosity of his children, Victor A. Regnier, Robert D. Regnier, and Catherine M. Regnier, who sought to enrich the educational experience of Kansas State University architecture students by exposing them to the finest architects from around the world.\\r \\r Attendance at any CAPD-sponsored lecture can be submitted as continuing education credit by design professionals by contacting Diane Potts.\\r \\r For more information, contact:\\r Peter Magyar, 785.532.5953\\r Torgeir Norheim, 785.532.5953",

He is your ally. He is our ally, be he at the other end of the world.' -Savitri Devi     Before you begin to mount feeble accusations of 'hater' and 'racist', let's get a few things straight. Many countries fought on the side of Hitler's Germany in WW2, including several non-white ones. One of Germany's primary allies of the 'Tripartite Pact' (signed on September 27, 1940) was not white, Japan. In fact, when the USA declared war on Japan the next year Germany honored the Tripartite Pact and declared war on the United States.      Indians, Asians, Arabs and blacks not only fought on the side of National Socialist Germany, but also wore the eagle and swastika proudly on their breast. Dozens of nationalities volunteered for the elite Waffen-SS and many non-whites of a wide range of ethnic backgrounds served the Axis in many capacities. In fact, it was the largest multi-racial fighting force in history! Not to mention also the most religiously diverse as well.      Commando Extraordinaire Otto Skorzeny describes the diverse nature of the Waffen-SS in his 1975 memoirs: '...from 1942 European soldiers from many lands and peoples could be found: Albanians, Bosnians, Britons, Bulgarians, Cossacks, Croats, Danes, Dutch, Estonians, Finns, Flemings, French, Georgians, Greeks, Hungarians, Italians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Norwegians, Romanians, Russians, Serbs, Slovakians, Swedes, Swiss, Ukrainians, Walloons, Armenians, Byelorussians, Hindus, Kirghizes, Tartars, Turkmen and Uzbeks served under their own flags in the Waffen-SS. Almost all of these peoples were represented in my unit.'  By the end of the war foreign members of the Waffen-SS outnumbered Germans! An average of six out of every ten men in the Waffen-SS were foreign volunteers. The English historian Antony James Beevor has this to say about what developed between these enormously brave and courageous men: 'an extraordinary comradeship of the damned had grown up among the foreign volunteers defending the last bastion of German nationalism.' (Berlin: The Downfall, 1945. ©2003)      During the terrible 1944/45 siege of Budapest a wide variety of nationalities and races fought under the swastika: 'The SS units comprised almost all nationalities -- in addition to ethnic Germans, [...] French Alsatians, Hungarians, Serbs, Slovaks, and Romanians, and Finnish, Flemish, Swedish and Spanish volunteers. The baggage trains of the SS divisions included Russian, Ukrainian, Tatar, and other auxiliaries. One artillery detachment consisted mainly of Poles, and several of its members were buried in Polish uniforms with German insignia.' -The Siege of Budapest, ©2005, Krisztián Ungváry, pg. 75      These were men ready to die for their beliefs, and many of them did. They believed strongly and passionately. Together, as one, come what may. Despite the so-called 'democracies' preventing them from defeating communism, their efforts and sacrifices most likely prevented communism from infecting all of Europe, and likely the world.      The Germans did not segregate their troops. Blacks, Asians, Arabs and Whites all fought and lived and died side-by-side. A sharp contrast to the American and British treatment of non-whites that fought for them. These unfortunate troops were often used as cannon fodder and not even allowed to fight with white troops.      The Japanese Americans who volunteered for the U.S. military were fighting for a country who had interned their families in concentration camps. Over 110,000 Japanese people who lived on the Pacific coast were interned with no crime other than being born Japanese. George Takei, of Star Trek fame, was one of the many victims of American racist policy. Here's his account of his experience in American concentration camps during WWII:      'I was only a child when soldiers with bayonetted rifles marched up our driveway, banged on our door, and ordered us out. I remember my mother's tears as we gathered what little we could carry, and then were sent to live for many weeks in a single cramped horse stall. Our bank accounts were frozen, our businesses shuttered, and our homes with most of our belongings were left behind, all because of what we looked like.'      'A few months later, we were shipped off to the swamps, over a thousand miles away, by railcar. They placed in all one hundred twenty thousand of us inside barbed wire fences, machine guns pointed down at us from watch towers. We slept inside bug-infested barracks, ate in a noisy mess hall, and relieved ourselves in common latrines that had no walls between the stalls. We were denied adequate medicines, shelter and supplies. I remember as a child looking up toward a U.S. flag in the room, as we recited the Pledge of Allegiance, those ironic words echoing, \"with liberty, and justice for all.\"'      'Executive Order 9066, signed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was issued on the premise that anyone of Japanese descent could not be trusted and was to be treated as an enemy, even those of us who were American citizens, born in this land. We were viewed not as individual people, but as a yellow menace to be dealt with, and harshly. The guns pointed at us at every point reminded us that if we so much as tried to stand up for our dignity, there would be violent consequences. The order and the ensuing confinement was an egregious violation of the constitution and of due process as we were held, without trial and without charge, awaiting our fate.'      The American government turned the war against Japan into a race war. A mountain of American WWII posters and other propaganda materials center on race. They pounded it into the public's head that the Japanese were less than human, even akin to rats. This caused numerous atrocities against Japanese soldiers and Japanese civilians during the war, as the American soldier was taught that these people weren't human. The Japanese-Americans were treated as less than human by the Unites States government. During a search of the barracks of one camp: '...soldiers aimed the machine gun at the unarmed prisoners and forced them to stand in the snow for hours in their underwear...' -Inside America's Concentration Camps, James L. Dickerson, 2010, pg.143      President Roosevelt even referred to the camps as 'concentration camps' on a few occasions. And that's exactly what they were. '...the camp itself was startling. Six tanks were lined up in a threatening way. A double barbed-wire fence was built around the camp. And the guard was increased to more than one thousand armed soldiers.... -Inside America's Concentration Camps, James L. Dickerson, 2010, pg.140     Author James L. Dickerson rightfully referred to these Japanese people as 'a people who had been stripped of their freedoms and imprisoned in camps just a notch above dog kennels...'      It is a little known fact that thousands of Americans of Italian, Latin-American, and German ethnicity were also thrown into American concentration camps. Even Aleut people in Alaska were interned. A neatly hidden fact.      There are many books that document this scarcely known treacherous act. Some examples are: Una Storia Segreta : The Secret History of Italian American Evacuation and Internment During World War II by Lawrence Distasi ©2001      American wartime law greatly restricted the freedoms and required identity cards of 600,000 Italian 'resident aliens'. 10,000 Italian-Americans along the West Coast were forcibly relocated and 250 were actually imprisoned in concentration camps for up to two years. Some Italian Americans were even forced to abandon their own homes and businesses. Shattered Lives, Shattered Dreams: The Untold Story of America's Enemy Aliens in World War II by Russell Estlack ©2011     The tyrannical lunacy these Americans were forced to endure by the American government is staggering. Some camps, during freezing cold winters, did not even have heat! 'Italians were required to remove pictures of Mussolini from display in their homes. U.S. officials went to Italian homes and collected guns and shortwave radios. Josephine Pandolfi Belenchia said that they even took an Italian version of Romeo and Juliet from their home.' -The Delta Italians, Paul V. Canonici, 2003      More than 10,000 German-American civilians were thrown into concentration camps in America during WWII. None of them were ever compensated for the loss of property or the time they spent in concentration camps. We Were Not the Enemy: Remembering the United States’ Latin-American Civilian Internment Program of World War II by Heidi Donald ©2007     Here is the description of the book: 'The United States clandestinely funds the operation of a huge prison in Cuba. Men, women, and children are spirited away from their homes and imprisoned indefinitely. No charges are made; no legal counsel is allowed. Newspapers fill with stories of espionage and enemies. Current events? No. During World War II, the United States used tactics remarkably similar to those in use today against presumed terrorists. By 1939, President Franklin Roosevelt had covertly authorized J. Edgar Hoover's Secret Intelligence Service to begin surveillance of Axis nationals in Latin America. Believing that \"all German nationals without exception [are] dangerous,\" the United States surreptitiously pressured Latin-American countries to arrest and deport more than four thousand civilians of German ethnicity to the United States. There, many languished in internment camps, while others were shipped to war-torn Germany.' The Prison Called Hohenasperg: An American Boy Betrayed by His Government During World War II by Arthur D. Jacobs ©1999     The book's own description best describes this unbelievable and truly insane book: 'Unknown to most Americans, more than 10,000 Germans and German Americans were interned in the United States during WWII. This story is about the internment of a young American and his family. He was born in the U.S.A. and the story tells of his perilous path from his home in Brooklyn to internment at Ellis Island, N.Y. and Crystal City, Texas, and imprisonment, after the war, at a place in Germany called Hohenasperg. When he arrived in Germany in the dead of winter, he was transported to Hohenasperg in a frigid, stench-filled, locked, and heavily guarded, boxcar. Once in Hohenasperg, he was separated from his family and put in a prison cell. He was only twelve years old! He was treated like a Nazi by the U.S. Army guards and was told that if he didn't behave he would be killed.'      One of the famous American 'Tuskegee Airmen', Alexander Jefferson, wrote a book called 'Red Tail Captured, Red Tail Free' where he talks about being a second class citizen in his own country. He was shot down and put into a German P.O.W. camp where for the first time in his life he wasn't segregated from the white troops. He recalls the incredible irony of finally being freed and returning home and no sooner did he walk off the ship when he was told 'Whites to the right, niggers to the left'!     While America was supposedly fighting for 'freedom' and 'democracy' in Europe, blacks were rioting and violently fighting for their rights back in America. For example, in 1943 black Americans rioted in the city of Detroit--the heavy hand of 'freedom' killed twenty-four of them!      Another example of America's hypocrisy and outright brutality was the inhuman treatment of WW2 veteran Isaac Woodard, Jr. (March 18, 1919 – September 23, 1992). This black American was attacked by South Carolina police in 1946, while still in his army uniform, just hours after being honorably discharged from the United States Army! This attack was so brutal it blinded Woodard for life!      Ironic that when America occupied Germany after the war they brought with them their racist policies which were previously unknown in Germany.      The book The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943-1944, by Rick Atkinson (Macmillon, 2007) gives us some very interesting statistics of Allied racism: 'When War II began in September 1939 fewer than 4000 blacks served in the U.S. Army; more than two years later the U.S. Navy had only six black sailors-excluding mess stewards. At the time of the Anzio landings (May 1944), the U.S. Army had 633,000 officers, of whom only 4,500 were black. The U.S. Navy was worse, with 82,000 black enlisted sailors and no black officers; the Marine Corps which had rejected all black enlistments until President Roosevelt intervened, would not commission its first black officer until several months after the war ended... …blacks were shunted into quartermaster companies for duties such as truck drivers, bakers, launderers, laborers and the like.' Now the Hell Will Start by Brendan I. Koerner © 2008     Blacks performed the jobs no one else wanted. They were subjected to 16 hour work days in the sweltering jungle heat, along with leeches, legions of mosquitoes, malaria and dysentery. It was called 'the toughest job ever given to U.S. Army Engineers in wartime.'      One particular story of this hell was brought to light by the case of a black soldier who killed another soldier and became the subject of 'the greatest manhunt of WWII'.    These American blacks were little more than forced labor gangs. Beasts of burden. But every dog has his day. Perry had his. And died a Man. 'An African American GI assigned to a segregated labor battalion, Perry was shipped to South Asia in 1943, enduring unspeakable hardships while sailing around the globe. He was one of thousands of black soldiers dispatched to build the Ledo Road, a highway meant to appease China's conniving dictator Chiang Kai-shek. Stretching from the thickly forested mountains of North-East India across the tiger-infested vales of Burma, the road was a lethal nightmare, beset my monsoons, malaria, and insects that chewed men's flesh to pulp. Perry could not endure the jungles brutality, nor the racist treatment meted out by his white officers.' And: '...Perry won the admiration of officers forced to witness the execution for his cool courage in the face of certain death. Never once did he break even as he walked up stairs to the gallows platform' -Now the Hell Will Start by Brendan I. Koerner, pg. 299, ©2008     On the way up to the gallows, rather ominously, Perry said to the guard escorting him: 'Now, the hell will start.'     A 1944 German propaganda leaflet targeting black American soldiers stated truthfully: 'In World War I they promised your father's racial equality as a reward for fighting the war. What did they get? What did you get? The lousiest jobs. The lousiest flats. The lousiest pay. The lousiest chances. Poverty, Unemployment, Race Riots, Lynching, Hanging and Burning! and The general contempt of all Whites in the U.S.A. RICH (WHITE) MAN'S WAR POOR (COLORED) MAN'S FIGHT'     The black historian and sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois visited National Socialist Germany in 1936. He related that he received more respect from the German academics then from his white colleagues back in America. He was treated like a human being in Germany, and stated: 'The National Socialists did not show any trace of racial hatred toward blacks.'   Furthermore, the American diplomat and author Lawrence Dennis, who was bi-racial, born to a black mother and white father, also visited National Socialist Germany. Like Du Bois and other blacks who visited, he was treated warmly and like a human being for one of the first times in his life. He met and had discussions with the highest level of National Socialist authorities, including Adolf Hitler himself. Dennis even attended the Nuremburg rallies. He was so impressed with Adolf Hitler's Germany that he thought National Socialism could also save the United States, as it did Germany.     So much for the lies of WWII Germany being a bunch of racists huh? That was all carefully implemented to get the world to hate Germany and trick them into helping the Judeo-tyrants destroy her.      Again, let's shatter our expectations and learn a fact many Germans soldiers learned after the war: black Americans did not hate German soldiers the way their white counterparts often did. The reasons behind this are varied, but as we discuss on later pages, one of the main reasons was the black Americans understood the Germans' plight, and indeed many of them saw Adolf Hitler as the liberator that he was. Additionally, many Black Americans were not as taken by the Allied propaganda and downright lies as were white Americans. Perhaps it wasn't so easy to believe the words of an authority they largely viewed as their historical oppressor. Here is an interesting quote regarding the treatment of German P.O.W. soldiers after the war from Waffen-SS Panzergrenadier Hans Schmidt: 'Black American soldiers were nicer to us than were the white ones. Most of the white Americans with whom I had to deal with were oafs.' [Hans Schmidt (1927 - 2010), SS Panzergrenadier, page 334, ©2002]     When the capital of the German Reich, Berlin, crumbled there was over a dozen nationalities defending it. There were Americans, British, French, Italians, Russians, Waloonians, Danes, Norwegians, Swedes, Iranians, Spaniards, Africans... the list goes on and on. In fact the bulk of defenders were not even German. Artur Axmann, leader of the Hitler Youth, when fleeing through the fiery ruins of Berlin, was shocked when suddenly his group stumbled on: 'What we saw before our astonished eyes was a kind of SS international brigade-very few Germans but a lot of Danes, Swedes, Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians, Latvians and that French group called Kampfgruppe Charlemagne.' (O'Donnell, The Bunker, page 304)     Imagine that. The last stand of the Third Reich, defended by foreign born troops. They met a fiery death because they believed in what they were fighting for. Look it up.     Everywhere the German and Axis armies went they brought with them a high standard of living previously undreamt. To many remote parts of Russia they brought with them modern civilization itself. The liberating German and Axis armies encountered poverty and despair on a level that shocked them to the core. The deathly policies of communism had not only crushed people's livelihoods, but destroyed their spirits. Joseph Goebbels described it best in one of his last writings, on April 20, 1945, in a newspaper piece called 'Our Hitler', celebrating the Führer's 56th birthday: 'Our enemies claim that the Führer’s soldiers marched as conquerors through the lands of Europe — but wherever they came, they brought prosperity and happiness, peace, order, reliable conditions, a plenitude of work, and therefore a decent life. Our enemies claim their soldiers came to the same lands as liberators — but wherever they come there is poverty and misery, chaos, devastation and destruction, unemployment, hunger and mass death.'      There were plans for the German armies and its allies in Russia, fighting Communism, to link up straight-away with the Japanese armies. Imagine, these great world powers, allies for many years, of such different races and cultures, meeting as friends on the battlefield, and then fighting together for a common goal. The Land of the Rising Sun and the Sons of the Swastika.      Japan wanted an Asia for Asians. The European occupiers had practically enslaved the Asian people in their 'colonies.' Germany and her European allies were also fighting those same world powers. They also believed that a people should be led by their own race. The world would then be in balance, the way nature intended. In fact, when Japan liberated the Asian islands and nations previously occupied by Europeans, they asked Germany if it wanted a share of these lands, and the answer was no! For too long empires, conquest, and ultimately greed, had set out to enslave foreign lands.   A Japanese leaflet from 1944 explains Japanese intentions in a few words [Note: Nippon = Japan]: 'Nippon today is engaged in the most titanic struggle against Anglo-American aggression for the purpose of freeing all Asians from their odious encroachment. Nippon is resolutely determined more than ever to crush Asia's foes decisively in order to establish lasting peace and prosperity in East Asia and emancipate the one billion Asians from centuries of Occidental domination.'      The Allies pushed lies about German racism throughout the Arab world, but the Arabs laughed at such claims. German actions spoke much louder than Allied lies. Here is an important quote from a letter written by the Prime Minister of Iraq, Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani, to Germany's Dr. Walter Gross' Office of Racial Policy in October 1942: 'The Axis enemies in their propaganda state that the Germans consider the Arabs among the lower castes. In my capacity as the Premier of Iraq, I can give an assurance that the Arabs do not give this claim any importance after what they have seen and felt Germany's treatment and help to them. But as the enemy propaganda goes on repeating these lies, I should like to receive an answer from an official source regarding the German consideration of the Arab race. I should be very grateful to get from you a reply on the opinion of Germany on the subject.' - Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani   Dr. Gross, a German physician who was head of the Office of Racial Policy for the NSDAP from 1933 until his suicide at the end of WWII, officially replied to Al-Gaylani as follows: 'In answer to your Excellency's letter of 17th October, 1942, I have the honor to give you the racial theory regarding the Arab caste. The racial policy has been adopted by Germany to safeguard the German people against the Jews who, biologically, are different from the Middle East races. Accordingly, Europe has been opposing Jews for decades. The Germans do not fight the Jews because they are Semitic or because they come from the East, but for their character, egoism and their hostility to society... while Germany forbids the entrance of the Jews into her territory, she welcomes all Arabs of Semitic origin and cares for them. The attitude of the Germans for the Arabs is that of respect. Not a single official German source ever stated that the Arabs originated from a lower caste. On the contrary, the racial theory of National Socialism considers the Arabs of a very high caste. The oppression of the Arabs of Palestine is being followed in Germany with great interest and Germany confirms the demands of the Arabs.' Also highly illuminating is an article written by Dr. Walter Gross, who, I remind you again because of its importance, was head of the Office of Racial Policy for the NSDAP: National Socialist Racial Thought -Dr. Walter Gross 'Most open to misinterpretation are National Socialist views on the relations between the various races of the world. It has been questioned whether the fundamental racial principles of the new world theory must not breed condescension, even contempt of people of different race. Quite the contrary; these very principles offer the very best guarantee for mutual tolerance and for the peaceful co-operation of all. We appreciate the fact that those of another race are different from us. This scientific truth is the basis, the justification and, at the same time, the obligation of every racial policy without which a restoration of Europe in our day is no longer practicable. Whether that other race is \"better\" or \"worse\" is not possible for us to judge. For this would demand that we transcend our own racial limitations for the duration of the verdict and take on a superhuman, even divine, attitude from which alone an \"impersonal\" verdict could be formed on the value or lack of such of the many living forms of inexhaustible Nature. But we of all people are too conscious of the inseparable ties of the blood and our own race to attempt to aspire to such an ultra-racial standpoint, even in the abstract. History, science and life itself tell us in a thousand ways that the human beings inhabiting the earth are anything but alike; that, moreover, the greater races are not only physically but especially spiritually and intellectually different from each other. Yesterday one passed this fact by, and in attempting to unify political, economic, cultural and religious standards for all nations of the earth, one was sinning against Nature, violating the natural attributes of various racial and national groups for the sake of a false principle. Today we bow to the racial differences existing in the world. We want every type of being to find that form of self-expression most fitted to its own particular requirements. The racial principles of National Socialism are, therefore, the surest guarantee for respecting the integrity of other nations. It is incompatible with our ideas to think of incorporating other nationalities in a Germany built up as a result of conquests, as they would always remain, because of their alien blood and spirit, a foreign body within the German State. Such foolhardy thoughts may be indulged in by a world which has as its goal economic power or purely territorial expansion of its frontiers, but never by a statesman thinking along organic, racial lines whose main care is the preservation of the greatness and along with it the essential unity of his people held together by the ties of blood relationship. For this reason, we have nothing in common with chauvinism and imperialism because we would extend to other races peopling the earth the same privileges we claim for ourselves: the right to fashion our lives and our own particular world according to the requirements of our own nature. And if National Socialism would wish to see the unrestricted mixing of blood avoided for the individual, there is nothing in this to suggest contempt. After all, we Germans ourselves, viewed ethnologically, are a mixture. The National Socialist demand is only that the claims of the blood and the laws of biology should be more closely observed in future. Here again our standpoint is not so very far removed from that of other people with a sound mental outlook. The American Immigration Laws, for instance, are based on definite racial discrimination. The Europeans and the inhabitants of India, the Pacific Islands, and so on, have instinctively held aloof from a mingling of the blood, and both sides genuinely regard any transgression as very bad form. Nevertheless, this natural attitude in no way detracts from the possibility of close co-operation and friendly interaction. And, speaking on behalf of the new Germany, let me once more emphasize: We do not wish our people to intermarry with those of alien race since through such mingling of the blood the best and characteristic qualities of both races are lost. But we will always have a ready welcome for any guests who wish to visit us whether of kindred or foreign civilization, and our racial views only lead us to a fuller appreciation of their essential peculiarities in the same way as we would want our own peculiarities respected.'      They've invested untold riches in hiding the facts presented on these pages from us. They've hidden the fact that Europe was fighting for its very existence. Far from what they've shoved into our heads, Germany was not alone in this fight. Europe and the world knew what was at stake. Adolf Hitler defined it best, in a speech on January 30, 1942: 'Lord God, give us the strength that we may retain our liberty for our children and our children's children, not only for ourselves but also for the other peoples of Europe, for this is a war which we all wage, this time, not for our German people alone, it is a war for all of Europe and with it, in the long run, for all of mankind.'      Anyone who knows the truth, knows that countries didn't lose the Second World War, mankind itself lost. The same age-old powers-that-be had won again. Their victory came at a terrible cost. They butchered tens of millions with their indiscriminate bombs. Over four million Germans died in concentration camps of starvation and the elements after the war was over. Look it up. Communist soldiers, berserk with propaganda, raped millions of German women, MILLIONS, from ages 6 to 90! Many of them after the war was over. Research it for yourself. You'll be amazed at what's been hidden from us. The infamous Der Untermensch. We were taught that this book was overflowing with hatred for the Poles, Russians and Slavs in general. But like most things we've been taught about WWII it is a lie! It's recently been reprinted so you can see for yourself, as I did. The truth is there is no racial hatred at all within its pages. The Untermensch is more a character of man. Read the back of the book here for a detailed description.   Recently declassified United States documents reveal that the president of the United States knew about the impending attack on Pearl Harbor and did nothing about it. In fact, he and his administration took measures to hide it. Not only did they know about it in advance, but they also instigated it. They would do anything to bring America into WW2, and since Japan was a friend and ally of Germany, they knew that by instigating a war with Japan, Germany would have to follow. They violated Japan's waters and even strafed her boats with machine gun fire. The information is out there, take the time to find it.      We implore you, question what you've been taught. We've all been taught lies. The good guys lost World War Two. Mankind lost World War Two. The tyrants won. But the war isn't over. Free men and women, white, black, red, yellow and brown are learning the truth.      The truth will make you angry. The lengths they have gone to lie to us. No matter your country of origin you are a victim of the same propaganda lies. It is international. They want to divide and conquer us. They want us to hate and fear one another. But in reality, it is They who hate all of us. And it is They who shall learn to fear us as well.      Given time, and our old Gods' will, all races shall unite and wipe this tyrant from the face of the earth. And this blue planet will sigh, bearing a lighter load, less millions of its killers and enslavers. And all of this terrible dark time will be a story to tell our children's children. It is a fated time to come. After the fire. A world anew.      But pictures speak louder than words! Don't take our word for it, look and see for yourself! And ask yourself, why did they hide this truth from us?",

Lento - Tranquillo: 1:40:10 \"Peer Gynt\" Op.23, is the incidental music to Henrik Ibsen's 1867 play of the same name, written by the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg in 1875. It premiered along with the play on 24 February 1876 in Christiania (now Oslo). Grieg later created two suites from his Peer Gynt music. Some of the music from these suites have received coverage in popular culture. Edvard Grieg was one of the definitive leaders of Scandinavian music and his influence was great. Although composing many short piano pieces and chamber works, the work Grieg did for Henrik Ibsen stood out. When Ibsen asked Grieg to write music for the play in 1874, he reluctantly agreed. However, it was much more difficult for Grieg than he imagined. \"Peer Gynt progresses slowly,\" he wrote to a friend in August 1874, 'and there is no possibility of having it finished by autumn. It is a terribly unmanageable subject.' 'The more he saturated his mind with the powerful poem, the more clearly he saw that he was the right man for a work of such witchery and so permeated with the Norwegian spirit,' his wife wrote of him and his music. Even though the premiere was a 'triumphant success', it prompted Grieg to complain bitterly that the Swedish management of the theatre had given him specifications as to the duration of each number and its order: 'I was thus compelled to do patchwork... In no case I had the opportunity to write as I wanted... Hence the brevity of the pieces' he said. Originally, Grieg composed 90 minutes of orchestral music for the play, he later went back and extracted certain sections for the suites. Peer Gynt's travels around the world and distant lands are represented by the instruments Grieg chooses to use. For many years, the suites were the only parts of the music that were available, as the original score was not published until 1908, one year after Grieg's death, by Johan Halvorsen. The complete score of the incidental music includes several songs and choral pieces. The complete score was believed to be lost until the 1980s and has been performed in its entirety only since then.

      "description": "🦋🦋 Justine Waddell 🦋🦋 Long before she recited her first line as an actress, Justine Waddell was playing roles -- real-life roles. First, she was a South African child, then a Scottish adolescent, and finally an English teenager after her family planted itself in London. There, Waddell took root and blossomed as one of Britain's finest young actresses. But she wasn't finished with multiculturalism. During and after her education at Cambridge University, she played characters in adaptations of English, Norwegian, French, and Russian authors. Then, in Dracula 2000, based on Irish-born author Bram Stoker's Dracula, she played an Englishman's daughter living in America who is pursued by a Transylvania vampire. Obviously, the world has been very much with Waddell, as Wordsworth might observe, and it is no wonder that she studied political science and sociology at Cambridge's Emmanuel College. There are, however, at least two constants in Waddell's life: one, striking beauty; two, extraordinary acting talent. The latter quality is, of course, the more important. But it doesn't hurt for an actress to have a stunning face and a symmetrical body when she is trying out to play Tess in Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles or Estella in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. Waddell played both roles, to the delight of audiences and critics, in TV miniseries. Waddell was born in Johannesburg 4 November 1975 . Her Scottish-born father, Gordon Waddell, was a member of Parliament and an employee of De Beers, the world's largest producer and distributor of diamonds. Her South African-born mother, Cathy Gallagher Waddell, was a fashion designer who also operated a small shop in Soweto, a ghetto southwest of Johannesburg that rebelled often against unfair laws. To escape the dangerous social climate in South Africa, the Waddells moved to Kelso, Scotland, near the tranquil River Tweed, in the mid-'80s. About four years later, they moved to London, where Justine Waddell attended a school on Baker Street and eventually enrolled in Cambridge. Though not a school of drama as such, it did offer courses that introduced her to acting. While still a student there, she played Joan of Arc in the Edinburgh Festival's production of Jean Anouilh's drama The Lark. Then came roles in period costume dramas requiring her to squeeze into corsets and plumb the keen insights she gleaned as a cultural hybrid. Among the roles that challenged her were Sasha (opposite Ralph Fiennes) in Chekhov's Ivanov, performed in London and Moscow, and Nina in Ibsen's The Seagull, performed in Stratford-upon-Avon. She also played Laura in Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White, Countess Nordston in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, Tess in Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Julia in Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, Estella in Dickens' Great Expectations, and Molly in Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives and Daughters. Now at age 49 Justine Waddell has reached a time in her life that movie parts become very hard to find. Her last acting part was in 2013. She has now moved into producing movies. Personal Note: I very much enjoy watching British movies. To me they seem to appeal to an intelligent audience. Movies made in the USA concentrate on violence and lean hard on special effects, very little story line. Call me old fashion but I know a lot of you feel the same way. This subject & movies are dedicated to you.",

Our family trip to Red Russia in 1931 started my dedication to anti-Communism. We were taken behind the scenes by friends working for the Soviet Government and saw deplorable conditions, first hand. We were appalled, not only at the forced labor, the squalid crowded living quarters, the breadline rationcard workers' stores, the mothers pushing wheelbarrows and the begging children of the State nurseries besieging us. The open virulent anti-Christ campaign, everywhere, was a shock. In public places were the tirades by loud speaker, in Russian (our friends translated). Atheist cartoons representing Christ as a villain, a drunk, the object of a cannibalistic orgy (Holy Communion); as an oppressor of labor; again as trash being dumped from a wheelbarrow by the Soviet \"Five-Year-Plan\"--these lurid cartoons filled the big bulletin boards in the churches our Soviet guides took us to visit. In the Museum of the Revolution we were shown a huge world map. As our Guide turned a switch, lights came on indicating the places all over the world where Communist Party headquarters were then functioning. Proudly our Guide announced: \"Our world revolution will start with China and end with the UNITED STATES\". \"O, NO! Not THAT\", was my thought. But, country by country, the boast has been steadily advancing. I took pictures of the anti-Christ posters on the porch of St. Isaac's Cathedral in Leningrad. Russia Changes My Life We were taken to the beautiful Church of the Redeemer in Moscow which was then, we were told, about to be dynamited to make way for a \"Palace of Soviets\". There was a display of full-sized mannikins dressed in the robes of the Church carrying on the Good Friday Footwashing ceremony. Our Guide rasped: \"This was to show that if the Archbishop could wash the feet of the humble priest the poor should endure their sufferings without complaint! Religion was always for the suppression of the people, to keep them working from dawn to late at night under the lash!\" I thought of our Savior washing the feet of His Disciples as an example, and telling them that he who would be great among you should be the servant of all (John 13:13-15; Matt. 23:11). I glanced up at the exquisite stained glass window of Christ, about to be demolished, and a little tear trickled down my cheek as I thought: \"I can never hate You like that!\" (I did not know then that the Pharisee Talmud gives Him FIVE sadistic deaths today). Staying at my hotel was the representative of a foreign country. He told me of the police terror; how the last manager of that hotel had been whisked off in the middle of the night by the \"Black Mariah\"--like millions of others never to be seen again. Some of our party had been taken to the police station; they had laughed in a movie theatre. They were released when they explained that they had laughed at a private joke, not at the picture (which was Soviet-made). After this, and more, I returned to the \"NICE\" North Shore of Chicago where the \"intelligentsia\" were rendering brainwashed reverence to the \"great Soviet Experiment\". Lecturing Behind the backs of the careless Guides I had taken movies of the rickety trains, etc., in Russia. By chance I started showing these movies to patriotic audiences, my husband running the projector as I told the story. Articles written for a little local newspaper were reprinted by the DAR and larger and larger groups called for my talks: District meetings of the Legion; the Military Intelligence; churches from coast to coast. I was recommended for all Chambers of Commerce, and spoke for the Minneapolis, Cleveland, Los Angeles, etc., groups. I broadcast over the Moody Bible Institute radio and its head became my closest friend to her death. Dr. Ironside introduced me as the only woman he had ever asked to occupy his pulpit in the Moody Church. I spoke in the great church of Dr. W. B. Riley, organizer of the World Fundamentalist Assn., my defender to his death. I frequently spoke in Detroit churches and on numerous occasions was entertained at the executives' table at the Ford plant. Henry Ford (who never changed his mind about the role of Jewry) had me write (1939) a report on the U. of Michigan (80 pages). He contributed that year $5,000 to the cost of my office labor which cost $12,000 that year. The head of the National Sojourners had me airmail my two books to Sen. Royal Copeland to give to Vice Pres. Garner who, I was told, stayed up all night reading them and had his friend Cong. Dies of Texas start up the Dies Committee on Un-American Activities (later called the House Com.) as a result. The hub of world Jewish anti-Christ power, the financial and industrial power best described in Rev. 18:11-, is the AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE with its B'nai B'rith brotherhood, and its \"secret police\", smear and ruin arm, the Anti-Defamation League. After having pushed a reluctant USA into World War II--to spread Communism across the earth, and with its first world base, Soviet Russia, as our \"ally\", it was decided to crush all ANTI-COMMUNISTS by trying them as \"Fascists, Nazis\". A series of indictments against some 30 anti-Communists, of which I was one, was engineered by the American Jewish Committee, in 1942, 1943, 1944. The 1942 indictment never came to trial. The 1943 indictment was dismissed in Washington by Judge Adkins. Only the 1944 indictment went to trial under a stooge judge Eicher. An unbelievable farce was staged without any legality or fact. After the death of judge Eicher, the case was dismissed by Judge Bolitha Laws with the scathing denunciation that it had been a crime to hold those people on trial all that time without a single piece of evidence in accordance with the charge being introduced by the prosecution against ANY defendant. The Communist press had been gloating that the \"sedition trial\" was part of the \"Moscow Purge trials\" then in session all over Europe. I reproduced the item on one of my Bulletins, sent to every Congressman. Background of E. D. Travel in more than 60 countries convinced me that the USA had the greatest system of government, and was the most fortunate nation on earth. I did not want it Sovietized, collectivized. Careful research and documentation have resulted in the fact that nothing I have ever printed has, to date, been refuted by friend or foe. BORN in CHICAGO, daughter of Dr. L. Kirkpatrick, physician and surgeon, of Virginian, Scotch-Irish, Presbyterian ancestry. My mother. Elizabeth Harding, descended from a long line of Anglican bishops thru her father. Her mother, Jane Musquet, was of English-French descent with a Catholic priest uncle in Paris. I married Albert Dilling, of Norwegian Lutheran ancestry.

After attending the University of Chicago she married, and for many years devoted her life to her children, social activities on the North Shore of Chicago, and being a concert harpist. After hearing of the great \"humanitarian experiment\" in Soviet Russia, she traveled there in 1931, and was able to go behind the scenes. She was shocked at the forced labor, the squalid living quarters, and deplorable living conditions, and the atmosphere of fear created by the Soviet dictatorship. She was most shocked by the virulent anti-Christianity of the atheist Communist regime. Following her return to the United States she lectured and wrote about what she had seen, realizing from the opposition which immediately arose that a substantial Marxist movement was active in the United States. In 1934 her first book The Red Network was published, and exposé of the persons and organizations furthering Red causes in the United States. In 1936, her second book, The Roosevelt Red Record and Its Background, was published. Almost immediately after these books were published, she was attacked as \"anti-semitic,\" although she had actually offered her anti-Communist services to Jewish organizations, and knew nothing of organized Jewish involvement in the Marxist movement.  After researching and studying, however, in 1940 she published her third book The Octopus, which dealt with these subjects. After World War II commenced, Mrs. Dilling became convinced that, despite President Roosevelt's protestations that not one American boy would ever again fight on foreign soil, there was a movement afoot to involve the United States, with the result that a substantial part of the world would be communized later. In 1941, she led a Mother's March on Washington to oppose the \"Lend Lease\" bill, proclaimed to help keep us out of war by its sponsors, but proving the last step for our involvement. The bill passed by only one vote. A few months later, the United States went to war. In 1944, Mrs. Dilling's views involved her in the now infamous mass \"sedition\" trial. The case was ultimately dismissed  by a Federal Court as \"a travesty on justice.\" She was later remarried to Jeremiah Stokes, a Christian anti-Communist writer, and she continued to write and lecture in behalf of Christianity and Constitutional Americanism, first publishing this book in 1964. Mrs. Dilling Stokes died in 1966 at the age of 72.  → http://www.come-and-hear.com/dilling/whois.html  → http://www.come-and-hear.com/dilling/dcontents.html#foreword ~ VIDEO CHAPTER LINKS: Who is Elizabeth Dilling?:     →    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss2Yg0e4rkI&list=PLF8oIBKeJMS58ujSh2VOY1nlLNi1fXVmP&index=1 Plot Against Christianity - Foreward:     →    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahKbQlH3eA4&list=PLF8oIBKeJMS58ujSh2VOY1nlLNi1fXVmP&index=2 I.

(The pilot for this ultimately 12-episode show was broadcast on May 10th 1976.) Ben Murphy played the title role, a man who has a watch that makes him invisible if pressed, but can only be invisible 15 minutes at a time or else he will vanish forever; also co-starred Katherine Crawford and William Sylvester. This episode - involving the transport of very dangerous fuel - featured among the guest stars Jim Stafford (of \"Spiders and Snakes\" and \"My Girl Bill\" fame). A mini-bonus will follow. Also of significance, later on that night, the first of three Presidential debates between Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter would be held. 😄 Fuzzy's Note: I would be remiss if I did not also mention that this episode of Gemini Man comprises a good portion of my favorite Mystery Science Theatre 3000 episode of all time - \"Riding with Death\".

He won two Pulitzer Prizes. By ALLAN KOZINN Published: November 5, 2012 Elliott Carter, the American composer whose kaleidoscopic, rigorously organized works established him as one of the most important and enduring voices in contemporary music, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 103 and had continued to compose into his 11th decade, completing his last piece in August. Related       An Appraisal: Elliott Carter, Master of Complexity (November 7, 2012)       In Carter's Music, Look for the Plot (October 27, 1991) color in theater Elliott Carter at a concert celebrating his 100th birthday at Carnegie Hall in 2008. Neal Boenzi/The New York Times b&w small 2 people Mr. Carter with Aaron Copland, right, in 1981. Richard Termine for The New York Times color small group Mr. Carter with James Levine, applauding, in 2006. Fred Plaut/Columbia Records b&w small vertical Mr. Carter in the mid-1950s. His work was considered difficult. His death was announced by Virgil Blackwell, his personal assistant. Mr. Carter died in his Greenwich Village apartment, which he and his wife bought in 1945 and where he had lived ever since. Mr. Carter’s music, which brought him dozens of awards, including two Pulitzer Prizes, could seem harmonically brash and melodically sharp-edged on the first hearing, but it often yielded drama and lyricism on better acquaintance. And though complexity and structural logic were hallmarks of his works, the music he composed in the decade leading up to his widely celebrated centenary, in 2008, was often more lyrical, if not necessarily softer at the edges. Mr. Carter, a protégé of the American modernist Charles Ives, acknowledged that his works could seem incomprehensible to listeners who were not grounded in the developments of 20th-century music. Even trained musicians sometimes regarded his constructions as too difficult to grasp without intensive study. Yet he had many advocates among players, and his works were frequently performed and recorded. “As a young man, I harbored the populist idea of writing for the public,” he once explained to an interviewer who asked him why he had chosen to write such difficult music. “I learned that the public didn’t care. So I decided to write for myself. Since then, people have gotten interested.” Mr. Carter never lacked for commissions from major orchestras, soloists and chamber groups, and late in life he was able to impose conditions on those who sought his works. He refused to be held to deadlines, saying he would release his compositions when he felt they were ready. And for many years he would not accept commissions from orchestras that had not played his earlier music. Long before he began enforcing that rule, however, many of Mr. Carter’s works had found their way into the active repertory. In the mid-1980s, he observed that hardly a year went by without at least one New York performance of his Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano With Two Chamber Orchestras (1961). His Cello Sonata (1948) is considered one of this century’s finest additions to that instrument’s repertory, and his solo keyboard works, the Piano Sonata (1946) and “Night Fantasies” (1980), are performed regularly and have been recorded several times. Mr. Carter continued to explore new ground into his later years. He avoided opera for most of his career because, as he put it in 1978, “American opera is a novelty, to be played once and that’s all, even when they’re good pieces,” and because he doubted he could find a libretto that interested him. Yet when he was 90 he completed his first opera, “What Next?” The opera, with a Dadaistic libretto by Paul Griffiths, a former music critic for The New York Times, had its premiere in 1999 at the Berlin Staatsoper Unter den Linden, with Daniel Barenboim conducting. It had its American premiere in a concert version at Symphony Center in Chicago in 2000 and its first staged performance in the United States at Tanglewood in 2006 — an event filmed and released on DVD. As Mr. Carter’s centenary neared, the frequency with which his music could be heard only increased, making it clear that for at least two generations of young performers, even his thorniest works held little terror. In the summer of 2008, for example, the entire Festival of Contemporary Music at the Tanglewood Music Center was devoted to Mr. Carter’s work, with performances of dozens of pieces from every stage of his career (including several premieres). Mr. Carter attended most of the concerts. There were many such tributes that year, and the attention unnerved him, he said. “It’s a little bit frightening, because I’m not used to being appreciated,” he said in an onstage interview at Zankel Hall the night after a celebration with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. “So when I am, I think I’ve made a mistake.” Despite his years, he remained vital almost until the end. His last composition, “12 Short Epigrams,” a piano work for Pierre-Laurent Aimard, was completed on Aug. 13. Another piece, “Instances,” for Ludovic Morlot and the Seattle Symphony (commissioned with the Tanglewood Music Center), was completed in April. In June, in what Steve Smith, writing in The Times, called a “miracle of continuing miracles,” the New York Philharmonic performed the premiere of “Two Controversies and a Conversation.” (Mr. Smith called it a “pocket-size double concerto.”) “The applause for Mr. Carter, wheelchair bound but characteristically animated,” Mr. Smith wrote, “resounded thunderously.” Elliott Cook Carter Jr. was born in Manhattan on Dec. 11, 1908, the son of a wealthy lace importer. While he was a student at the Horace Mann School, he wrote an admiring letter to Ives, a New Englander with a crusty manner who nevertheless responded and urged him to pursue his interest in music. When Mr. Carter attended Harvard, starting in 1927, Ives took him under his wing and made sure he went to the Boston Symphony Orchestra concerts conducted by Serge Koussevitzky, who programmed contemporary works frequently. At Harvard, Mr. Carter completed a bachelor’s degree in English before deciding to study composition seriously. He studied with a group of celebrated teachers, including Walter Piston, Edward Burlingame Hill and Gustav Holst. He also received advice from Ives, although their friendship cooled after Mr. Carter made the mistake of showing Ives some compositions he had written in a neo-Classical style. In 1932, after completing his master’s degree, Mr. Carter went to Paris for three years of study with Nadia Boulanger, both privately and at the École Normale de Musique. While in Paris in 1933, he was commissioned to write incidental music for a production of Sophocles’ “Philoctetes” at the Harvard Classical Club. The work was his first to be performed in public. Mr. Carter returned to the United States in 1935, settling first in Cambridge, Mass., and then in New York City, where he began writing criticism for the influential journal Modern Music. In 1937 he began a two-year term as music director of Lincoln Kirstein’s Ballet Caravan, for which he wrote the ballet “Pocahontas” (1939), a work with echoes of Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” and the residue of an early interest in the music of the Elizabethan virginalists. He also wrote incidental music for Orson Welles’s Mercury Theater. A choral work, “To Music,” won a 1938 contest sponsored by the Federal Music Project of the Works Progress Administration. In 1939 he married Helen Frost-Jones, a sculptor and art critic. She died in 2003. Their son, David, survives Mr. Carter, as does a grandson. Mr. Carter’s works of this early period are in neo-Classical and neo-Romantic styles, their modernism kept in check because, as he later explained, the acidic experiments of the avant-garde seemed wrong for a world that was gripped by the Depression. Trying to write music that would appeal to a wide public, he composed an amusing setting of “The Siege of Corinth” (1941), to a Rabelais text, and his First Symphony (1942), an essay in a melodic, almost pastoral style. By the mid-1940s Mr. Carter had won several prizes but had made little headway with the public, and he began to regard his consonant style as an unrewarding compromise. In the Piano Sonata (1946) and the Woodwind Quintet (1948), he began writing with a sharper edge, and in the Cello Sonata he started the investigation of contrasting materials that remained a fascination. In this case the contrast was between a freely flowing, lyrical cello line and a disciplined, almost marchlike piano part. Desert Interlude The turning point in Mr. Carter’s style came in 1950, when a Guggenheim Fellowship and a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters allowed him to leave a teaching post at Columbia University and spend a year in southern Arizona, outside Tucson. During that year in the Sonora Desert he wrote a single 45-minute work, his First String Quartet. Recalling his desert sojourn, Mr. Carter said in a 1960 interview: “I had been waiting for just such an opportunity to give form to a number of novel ideas I had had over the previous years, and to work out in an extended composition the character, expression and logic these ideas seemed to demand. I felt that I was constantly pushing into an unexplored musical realm.” Internal Oppositions What he came up with was a process he called “metrical modulation.” Each instrument has a distinct personality and moves at an independent rhythm. The effect is of a constant change of tempos. Thereafter, virtually all of Mr. Carter’s works were driven by the tension between independent and starkly contrasting elements. In the Second String Quartet (1959), for example, each instrument is given its own distinct vocabulary of intervals and rhythms. In the Double Concerto of 1961, the piano and harpsichord, each allied to its own chamber orchestra, speak in languages appropriate to their timbres. In the first half of the work, the opposing groups move toward consensus; in the second, they split apart. Between the 1950s and the late 1970s, Mr. Carter typically spent several years on each new work and saw every piece as an opportunity to overcome new challenges, some purely musical and others narrative and dramatic. “I just can’t bring myself to do something that someone else has done before,” he said in 1960. “Each piece is a kind of crisis in my life.” Starting in the late 1980s Mr. Carter’s production picked up speed, and by 2005 he was routinely producing streams of works, albeit short ones, every year, sometimes at the request of musicians who admired his work and sometimes spontaneously for musicians he admired. When asked why his early works took so long to complete, Mr. Carter explained that his method of composing dictated his speed. “I like to sound spontaneous and fresh, but my first sketches often sound mechanical,” he said. “ I have to write them over until they sound spontaneous.” Many of his scores were completed only after he had filled thousands of pages with sketches. He meticulously dated and saved these, an idea he said he got from Igor Stravinsky. Mr. Carter intensified his use of contrasting forces in works like the Third String Quartet (1971) and the Symphony of Three Orchestras (1977). In these compositions the main ensemble is divided into subgroups, each of which is given a distinct set of movements. The movements are played simultaneously with those performed by competing groups. But they are not played in a conventional way, from start to finish. Instead, the players may be asked to play part of a first movement, all of a second and part of a third before returning to where they left off in the first. In works like “Syringa” (1978), a vocal setting of the poet John Ashbery’s updated version of the Orpheus legend, the internal oppositions are set forth more clearly. As a mezzo-soprano offers an understated account of the Ashbery text, a bass vehemently sings fragments of Greek classical texts. “I regard my scores as scenarios,” Mr. Carter said in 1970, “for the performers to act out with their instruments, dramatizing the players as individuals and as participants in the ensemble.” That interest remained with him. His String Quartet No. 5 (1995), for example, conveys his fascination with a quartet’s rehearsal methods, including the debates between players about phrasing and coloration. The work is in 12 connected movements, five of which are interludes that describe the discussions, with one player offering a phrase from the section just heard and the others responding with embellishments, humorous turns or consternation. Some listeners found his music cerebral, elitist and devoid of emotion. Even some who respected Mr. Carter’s erudition and the detail inherent in his compositional method were unmoved by his music. Reviewing the Concerto for Orchestra (1969) when Leonard Bernstein led the New York Philharmonic in the work’s world premiere, Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The Times, “It may be a tour de force of its kind, but to me it is essentially uncommunicative, dry and a triumph of technique over spirit.” In the mid-1970s, Mr. Carter’s music began to return to forms that he had not addressed since the 1940s. With “A Mirror on Which to Dwell” (1975) and “Syringa,” he began reconsidering the voice, and he continued his exploration in “In Sleep, in Thunder” (1981) and “Of Challenge and of Love” (1994), vocal chamber works that in retrospect seemed steps on Mr. Carter’s path to opera. Around the same time, “Night Fantasies” (1980), an evocative description of the fleeting states of thought one experiences between sleep and wakefulness, was the first in a stream of solo instrumental pieces for guitar, violin, trombone, flute, harp, clarinet, cello and piano. He also composed a series of concertos for various instruments, including oboe, violin and clarinet, and a 50-minute orchestral triptych, “Symphonia: Sum Fluxae Pretium Spei.” Indeed, Mr. Carter began composing at a brisk pace in the mid-1980s. Instead of spending several years writing a single piece, he was writing a handful of pieces a year. Moreover, they seemed to reach out to listeners in a way that the earlier works had not. The Oboe Concerto (1987) and the Violin Concerto (1990) were decidedly lyrical, even though Mr. Carter’s harmonic language remained essentially dissonant. And in the “Triple Duo,” (1983) the dialogues within and between the three independent instrumental groups are slyly witty and even overtly comic. Two Decades, Two Pulitzers Mr. Carter taught at several American conservatories and colleges, including the Peabody Conservatory, Queens College, Columbia, Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Cornell and the Juilliard School. He was awarded Pulitzer Prizes for his Second String Quartet in 1960 and his Third String Quartet in 1973. A recording of his Violin Concerto won a Grammy Award for best contemporary composition in 1994. Among his many awards was the National Medal of Arts, bestowed in 1985. In September, France awarded him the insignia of Commander of the Legion of Honor. Mr. Carter was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963 and to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1969. Mr. Carter did not seem bothered by objections to the difficulty of his music, and he expressed confidence that it would eventually be understood. “There are many kinds of art,” he said in 1978, when asked what he had to say to concertgoers who felt that great music should have tunes that could be whistled. “Some kinds are hard to understand for some people, and easy to understand for others. But if the works are very good, then finally a lot of people will understand them. And it seems to me that if a work has something remarkable to say, then someone who wants to whistle it will find something in it to whistle. But these things are very subjective. “Just this morning, I had a call from Ursula Oppens, who is playing my Piano Concerto. She said, ‘I finally know all the tunes in your concerto.’ I said, ‘Which tunes are those?’ And she whistled one. So there you are.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 7, 2012 An obituary on Tuesday about the composer Elliott Carter misstated, in some editions, the given name of the musical director of the Seattle Symphony, for which Mr. Carter composed the piece “Instances” this year. He is Ludovic Morlot, not Pierre Morlot. The obituary also misidentified the venue where the American premiere of Mr. Carter’s opera “What Next?” was performed. It was at Symphony Center in Chicago, not at Carnegie Hall. And because of an editing error, the obituary misstated the year that Mr. Carter’s wife, the former Helen Frost-Jones, died. It was 2003, not 1998.",

Praeludium II. Sarabande III. Gavotte IV. Air V. Rigaudon Despite the fact that Ludvig Holberg (1684 - 1754) lived most of his life in Denmark and was considered the father of Danish literature, his birthplace was Bergen, Norway, and for the bicentenary of his birth, Norwegians celebrated heartily. Even as a resident of Denmark, Holberg recalled in his works his childhood and celebrated the time that he spent there. Made a baron in 1747, his was an imposing reputation. Educated at the universities of Copenhagen and Oxford, Holberg's writings are regarded as having established Danish as a literary language. Prior to his time, Danish was employed only in ballads and hymns; plays were presented in French or German. Besides more than a dozen successful plays (several of them comedies), he wrote a history of his adopted country and published a collection of philosophical treatises. Notwithstanding his stronger relationship to Denmark, Norwegians were pleased to acknowledge Holberg, and Grieg, also a Bergen native, was one of those who directed the planning for the event. As early as 1878, he contributed a fee from his publisher to the erecting of a Holberg statue in Bergen. Further, he wrote two works, the first for male voices, a Cantata for the Unveiling of the Holberg Memorial, and a second (of more lasting consequence) entitled From Holberg's Time: Suite in Olden Style. Grieg himself, a more than capable pianist, premiered the piano suite just days after the dedication of the memorial. Its great success led Grieg to score it for string orchestra the following year. Both versions enjoy enduring popularity. The suite in five sections was intended by Grieg to recall the dance suites from Holberg's lifetime, which corresponded to the period of the Baroque. The Praeludium which opens the work is a section of such simple radiance that it imprints itself unforgettably on the listener's consciousness. The contrasting Sarabande moves soberly, reflectively, and with unfailing elegance. The Gavotte which forms the third section trips beguilingly over the course of its three minutes, yielding to the Andante religioso tempo of the Aria. The final section, a Rigaudon, returns the listener to the buoyant mood of the beginning prelude. Through each of the five sections, the level of invention is matched by a refinement and purity of feeling that marks this as among the most cherishable short works of the late nineteenth century.

      "description": "Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra：WAGNER – Parsifal A young man ignorant of everything, including his own name, arrives at the Kingdom of the Holy Grail. Is he the ‘pure fool, enlightened by compassion’, who, it has been prophesied, will purify the realm? Live from Bergen for a concert staging of Parsifal, Richard Wagner’s final music drama which is unlike anything that went before or has come since. It can feel more like a ritual ceremony than an opera – grand yet intimate, somehow occupying its own space and time. At the heart of Parsifal is a curious, magical treatment of the symphony orchestra that appears to give the voices above it all the space and autonomy they need. Following award-winning concert performances of Peter Grimes with Stuart Skelton in the title role, the Australian tenor returns to Bergen in the same capacity for this Parsifal under chief conductor Edward Gardner. Joining them is a fine cast including Johan Reuter as the wounded Amfortas, Brindley Sherratt as the wise old Gurnemanz and Ricarda Merbeth as the teasing Kundry. THE STORY Act I In the Pyrenees, the old Knight Titurel lives in the Castle of Montsalvat where the Grail is held. His son, Amfortas, had been injured by the magician Klingsor, enemy of the Knights of the Grail, by his own Holy Spear, the arm that injured the Christ. Amfortas can only be healed by the contact with this Spear. In the forest, around the castle, the Knight Gurnemanz and his two knaves meet Kundry, messenger of the knights of the Grail to whom Klingsor cast an evil spell. She brings a balsam from Arabia to cure the king. He accepts but it has been said that only 'an innocent with a pure heart' would be able to get the Lance back and cure him. A young man, guilty of having killed one of the sacred swans of Montsalvat, is brought in by a troop of warriors. It’s Parsifal, a young wandering knight, who seems to know nothing about his origins. Act II At the Castle of Klingsor, the latter asks Kundry to entice Parsifal to make him sin, so that he can retrieve the Holy Grail. Klingsor then transforms his castle into a beautiful garden where young girls in bloom use their charm to seduce Parsifal, in vain. Only Kundry is able to do so. As he realises that he has sinned, Parsifal composes himself and cries out his pain. Upset, Kundry understands she has to break Klingsor’s enchantment and look for redemption in Parsifal’s love. But Kundry is rejected by him, so she decides to call Klingsor who cast the Holy Spear. Parsifal seizes it, makes the sign of the cross: Klingsor and his castle get destroyed and Kundry faints. Act III Gurnemanz lives as a hermit not far from the mountain of Grail. Kundry visits him, asking him to serve again the Knights of the Grail when suddenly, a black-armored knight arrives: it’s Parsifal. Gurnemanz understands he is the 'innocent with a pure heart' and crown him king of Grail and baptizes Kundry. Back to the castle of Grail, Parsifal heals Amfortas by touching him with the Holy Spear. Eventually forgiven, Kundry dies.

      "description": "Care, Cure, Corruption Series An Enemy of the People By Henrik Ibsen Jane Page, Director April 30 – May 8, 2016 Little Theatre The future is looking bright in Dr. Stockmann's hometown on the coast of southern Norway. At his urging, the town has built therapeutic Baths, which will invite tourists and their dollars. However, trouble arrives when the Doctor discovers that the water of the Baths is teeming with bacteria, guaranteed to make everyone sick. Ridiculed and persecuted by the townsfolk for his honesty, he is declared an \"enemy of the people.\" This classic Ibsen text explores the intersection of standing alone to tell an uncomfortable truth versus bowing to the corruption of a complacent majority. It also questions whether there is even such a thing as absolute truth; in Ibsen’s words, \"A normally constituted truth lives—let us say—as a rule, seventeen or eighteen years, at the outside twenty, very seldom more. And truths so patriarchal as that are always shockingly emaciated.

It is important to listen to Classical orchestral music LOUD, as you would hear it in a concert hall.  Most classical programs provide background wallpaper, like listening to Beethoven way, way, way in the background of a Barnes and Noble bookstore.  Many people under 40 have had no good, fun and accurate introduction to Classical Music.

      "description": "Heidi Arnesen is a Norwegian filmmaker that directed the 1991 short Dual of the Senses , the first queer Norwegian short. She would later do 7 more shorts throughout the 90s. Her most recent short Night Ride  was nominated for an Oscar. In 1997, she would make her first & only feature with Some Prefer Cake . The film combines the world of stand-up and lgbt themes in the backdrop of San Francisco in the late 90s. It was written by Jeannie Kahaney, who also co-directed the movie; according to the film's credit.  Local SF comics appeared in the film, which includes: Julia Jackson, Doug Holsclaw, Mimi Gonzalez, Pola Mazursky & Aundre the Wonderwoman (offscreen voice). They have written and performed their materials in the movie except for Pola Mazursky, who plays a wacky character in the story. Local clubs were utilized in the film, such as Josie's Cabaret and Juice Joint & the Coco Club, which closed its doors in 1999 and 2000. Most of the actors in the film are local SF performers, with the only known actor being Desi del Valle ( Mod Fuck Explosion , Costa Brava ) playing Robin, the love interest for the main character Kira. However, the standout in the movie is Machiko Saito, who plays Katie; a needy stalker who goes after the main character and her friends. Machiko Saito is an interesting individual she's a filmmaker who directed 3 short films ( Premenstrual Spotting , 15 Minutes of Femme & Pink Eye ) and created a TV show called Femme TV . Pink Eye is the only one available, while the other two and Femme TV are considered lost media. She is also a photographer, costume designer, make-up artist, acting workshop leader, educator of drug and alcohol recovery, tutor, and teacher's assistant. It seems she's done it all lol. She may or may not be transgender, at least according to the Transgender Media Portal. But given that she doesn't have any online presence and not too much information about her, outside her work; it's all speculation. The film debuted in 1997 at the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival & a year later in 1998 at the New York Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. What happened to the cast & crew after the movie: -Heidi Arnesen went on to be a director for the Norwegian soap opera Hotel Cæsar  directing more than 140 episodes & would later start producing in the mid-2010s. -Jeannie Kahaney is a director at The New School in New York. -Kathleen Fontaine is a part of the San Francisco sketch comedy group Nude Coffee . She would do multiple one-person shows: Learning To Stay & Kathleen Fontaine: The Man, The Mystery! In 2017, Kathleen Fontaine transitioned to Quinn Fontaine and wrote a memoir documenting his new life as a transguy. -Desi del Valle left her position as a distribution director for Frameline in 2004 to focus on her career. She and Tara Howley collaborated again in the film Nightfall (2001), now considered lost media. She has attended various events for Columbia University (her alma mater), but it is unclear if she works for the Columbia Alumni Association or something else. -Machiko Saito appeared in a play called Contagion  in 2001. She would later be a program director, editor, and publisher for Roaddawgz, a drop-in center for homeless youth who are struggling writers, artists, and musicians. Is it unknown if Roaddawgz still operates or not? -Leon Acord created and starred in his show Old Dogs & New Tricks  with Fontaine being one of the producers. -Pola Mazursky goes by Pola Mazur these days so as not to be confused with Paul Mazursky. -Mimi Gonzalez is friends with Jessica Kirson, and they sure look alike!

      "description": "\"Axel Ejnar Hakon Børresen (June 2, 1876, Copenhagen – October 6, 1954, Copenhagen) was one of the foremost Danish composers of the 20th century. Work: Den Kongelige Gæst / The royal guest, opera in one act, first performance 15 November 1919, Royal Danish Theatre, Copenhagen. Libretto: Svend Leopold, based on a story by Henrik Pontoppidan. Ane: Edith Guillaume Arnold Höyer: Stig Fogh Andersen Servant: Lise-Lotte Nielsen Emmy: Tina Kiberg Guest: Guido Paevatalu Orchestra: Odense Symphony Orchestra Conductor: Tamás Vetö Synopsis: The story plays out an evening in a doctor's home on the Jutland peninsula around 1900. Dr. Høyer and his wife are expecting guests for a dress ball. However, all the guests decline at the last moment, and Dr. Høyer is irritated, but slightly relieved. Instead, the family receives a surprise visitor, the unknown gentleman Prince Carnival, who acts in a free and easy manner, playing the piano, talking with Dr. Hoyer's wife, and suggesting to the couple to carry on with the party.\" ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGHBhP_Sp7I&t=4s ) 2004 ------ \"Hakon Børresen 1876-1954 Hakon Børresen was to be one of the last Danish romantics. He had his break-through as a young man around the year 1900, and throughout his life he persevered in the attitudes to art and music that he had learned in his youth. He lived until 1954, and outlived almost all his like-minded Danish colleagues. In the course of his career Børresen did not write an overwhelming amount of music. Besides two operas, his major works are the three symphonies (1901, 1907, 1926), a violin concerto (1904, later performed by Arthur Nikisch, the greatest conductor of the age), a few excellent chamber works (including a sextet and two quartets) and a variety of ballet and stage music. Some of his lieder became very popular in their day, but it was in the opera The Royal Guest from 1919, more than any other work, that he found his element. Børresen was born in Copenhagen in 1876. His paternal grandfather was Norwegian, and at the end of the nineteenth century Copenhagen was still the city to which Norwegians came to carve out a career. The leading Norwegian musician in Copen-hagen in Børresen's time was the composer and conductor Johan Svendsen, who from 1883 until his death in 1911 was conductor of the Royal Danish Orchestra. He did not take on pupils, but at the age of 19 Børresen looked him up anyway for advice on whether his talent was sufficient for a career in music. Bringing with him his opus 1, the national-romantic orchestral piece Thor rides to Jotunheim, he seems to have -kindled a hope in the childless Svendsen of a successor. Svendsen had himself stalled in his composing career and took Børresen as his pupil. They developed what was almost a father-son relationship, and Svendsen remained Børresen's mentor for the rest of his life. Although Hakon Børresen was 11 years younger than his epoch-making colleague Carl Nielsen, he was more conservative, and besides his teacher he admired names like Gade, Grieg, Lange-Müller - and Wagner. Børresen's loyalty to the old world was so great that he would rather stop composing than give in to the musical developments of the period. From the mid-1920s on he wrote only about one piece a year, and after 1940 hardly anything. On the other hand he had a great influence on musical life. He was a powerful and authoritarian chairman of the Danish composers' society Dansk Tonekunstnerforening, and functioned as a kind of unofficial government consultant in musical matters. Later he became chairman of the National Musical Council, and in organizational matters he was the country's leading composer. An unpleasant but necessary palace revolution in the Danish Composers' Society in 1948 marked his sudden and sad farewell to Danish musical life. The aristocratic Hakon Børresen had a large apartment in the heart of Copenhagen and socialized with the Royal Family. But he spent his summers in Skagen in North Jutland, where Scandinavian artists had formed a colony as early as Børresen's childhood. Life in Skagen was also something Børresen persisted in as a framework for his artistic life. By the time of his death in 1954 he was an anachronism, yet he still remained a figure of dignity, kindness and great substance. The Royal Guest The Royal Guest is a little fable about how art and love can transform people and change their lives. The main characters are a married couple who are visited in their quiet, static home by a mysterious, effusive guest. With his message of joie de vivre and love he breathes new life into the couple he visits. The opera is based on a short story from 1908 by the great Danish author and Nobel Laureate Henrik Pontoppidan (1857-1943). Oddly enough the story also involves another great Danish author, Holger Drachmann (1846-1908). This requires some explanation, and the composer himself gave it when the opera was performed for the fiftieth time in 1942 at the Royal Opera in Copenhagen. In an interview he told the story behind the origin of the opera: Along with Henrik Pontoppidan I had attended Holger Drachmann's funeral in Skagen, and afterwards Pontoppidan said to me: 'Don't you know the little short story I wrote for a periodical called 'The Royal Guest'? That would be well suited to musical treatment, I think, and it should be no secret that the guest I was thinking of was Drachmann, his Renaissance personality and his marvellous poetry and beauty, which have become something shared by everyone. He has truly become a royal guest in all Danish homes!' Børresen considered the original story 'a fine subject for musical treatment - particularly inspiring when one had been under the influence of Drachmann's personality at festive artists' gatherings, or perhaps most of all in a narrow circle of friends [....] In all the homes into which Drachmann brought art and poetry, life became richer to live, but also more restless.' Whereas Pontoppidan was the realist, the thinker and the connaisseur of souls, Drachmann was the man of energy, the many-minded talent, the lover. Holger Drachmann's oeuvre was very large and versatile, including everything from popular musical productions to poems, novels and plays. He was even an able painter. His great gestures, his beard and hats and his self-dramatization as a ladies' man with many mistresses were all familiar to the public. In the decades after his death his collected works of many thousand pages were published in large printings. Since then his stock as an artist has been in decline, but if one looks at his popularity around the turn of the last century he is one of the most striking representatives of the period. Composers including Heise, Horneman, Grieg, Carl Nielsen and Lange-Müller all set his texts to music. During World War I Børresen was writing his first opera, Kaddara, which is set in Greenland. Børresen even went to Greenland to study life and song there, and the opera ended up as a huge, luxurious affair. When it was finished Børresen was given the rather strange information that the Royal Opera would have liked to stage Kaddara, but because of the war they did not have the coal reserves for such a lavish piece. 'Could you not instead write a small, short opera that we can put on together with a couple of ballets? We have just about had enough of the Italian operas I pagliacci and Cavalleria rusticana, which we normally use for this purpose,' said the director of the Opera, Johannes Nielsen. 'So the thought of The Royal Guest occurred to me, and I asked Pontoppidan if he would write the libretto, but he couldn't,' said Børresen. 'An opera libretto,' said Pontoppidan, 'that would be oh, woe and kiss and bliss - no, I'm no good at that.' By roundabout paths Børresen arrived at the versatile author and journalist Svend Leopold (1874-1942). 'He came up to see me in Skagen, where he wrote his excellent libretto in less than a fortnight, and I know that Pontoppidan was extremely satisfied with it,' Børresen reminisced in 2. At the Royal Opera the production was premiered with Poul Wiedemann as Dr Arnold Høyer, Tenna Kraft as Mrs Emmy Høyer and Arnold Høeberg as the Guest. The first performance on 15 November 1919 was conducted by Georg Høeberg, the brother of Arnold Høeberg, and one of Børresen's closest friends. For decades the opera was performed with the same cast, and quite incredibly Poul Wiedemann sang the role for 45 years (!), a total of 134 times, for the last time in 1964. After Poul Wiedemann's farewell performance The Royal Guest disappeared from the Danish opera repertoire, but the opera is still at the top of the list of the most frequently performed Danish operas ever. The Prelude to The Royal Guest also became a popular concert piece, and even at the end of the twentieth century, when the popularity of Børresen's music was at its lowest ebb, it was still a piece he was remembered for. Among the admirers of the Prelude to the opera was the King of Denmark, Frederik IX (1899-1972), who was an able conductor. He regularly attended performances of the opera with a score in front of him, and he had the Prelude in his repertoire (a recording with the King and the Danish National Symphony Orchestra / DR has been released on Dacapo 8.224158-59). In 1927, when the opera was to be performed in Stockholm, the King was even invited to conduct the production - and thus himself to be a 'Royal Guest' - but he modestly said no to the task. The Royal Guest is often spoken of as a 'conversation opera'. The roles are sung in a relaxed parlando, and there are no arias, although moments of emotion rise into more fully elaborated song lines, for example when the Guest describes his home ('I come from the castle east of the setting sun'). Hakon Børresen was in fact not a great melodist either, but for the chamber-play-like libretto he found a musical style that functioned perfectly for him. On the other hand it is very clear that he was a brilliant orchestrator. The many changes of mood and surprises in the action gave him the opportunity to really play with the instrumentation. Among his inventive devices are the way the orchestra includes the sound of the parlour piano (and a quotation from Schubert). Not least, the Guest's quirky, uninhibited flow of ideas is portrayed in the orchestral writing with great wit. The Prelude presents a number of motifs from the opera, most clearly the Guest's magnanimous arrival motif. This is a true 'festive polonaise' of the kind Børresen had learned to write from Johan Svendsen. Other themes in the Prelude are the Guest's above-mentioned arioso motif and a wistful passage for the woodwinds describing Emmy's thoughtfulness when the Guest has gone. Synopsis Scene One The action takes place in a quiet doctor's home in a remote part of Jutland around the year 1900. Doctor Arnold Høyer and his wife Emmy have been married for a few years and their relations have settled into a calm rut. They rarely have guests, and one day is like another. It is Shrovetide - a time of festivity and pranks - and the family is expecting visits from Copenhagen. Emmy and the old maid Ane are tidying up the home when at short notice the house receives the news that the guests are unable to come. Arnold is at first irritated, but then becomes quite content that his everyday life will not be disturbed. Scene Two In the evening sleigh bells are heard outside, and an unknown man appears as a guest. Høyer tries discreetly to ask about his identity, but the guest asks to remain anonymous. 'Call me Prince Carnival!' he says. Dr. Høyer goes along with the joke, and welcomes the stranger into his home. The Guest talks incessantly, is enigmatic but charming, sociable and to Emmy's delight also musical. To Arnold and Emmy's great surprise he asks that the three of them celebrate together dressed in their finest clothes. The Guest has decided he wants to arouse the spirit, wit and beauty he glimpses in them beneath the conventional surface. Scene Three At first Emmy refuses to follow the Guest's plan, but Arnold has gradually been infected by the fun. They withdraw to change into their finery. Scene Four The Guest too has changed into festive garb, and hastens to rearrange the whole parlour with flowers, candles and fruit while Arnold and Emmy are dressing. When they enter the parlour again, somewhat bewildered, they are overwhelmed to see their home transformed. The Guest designates Emmy Queen of the Feast, and they sit down at the table. Scene Five The Guest is an exuberant party companion who flirts with Emmy and in cryptic language describes his life among the mythological creatures of love. Arnold gradually becomes rapturous, partly from the wine and partly over his wife, who is in the silk dress of her youth. The party develops into a tribute to Eros, and the Guest crowns Emmy with roses in her hair. Suddenly Arnold feels the Guest has crossed the line. The Guest hastily gets up and takes his leave as abruptly as he came. On the doorstep he urges them one last time to let joy and magic into their life. Scene Six The disappearance of the Guest is a rude awakening for Arnold. At once he becomes his old buttoned-up self, and jealously scolds his wife for permitting the flirting. There is a confrontation between the couple, but they make it up, and admit that they have learned something from the evening. The disturbance of their everyday life has opened their eyes to important sides of life, and they choose to seize the opportunity to let the life-giving excitement in. Like a couple who have just fallen in love, they go arm in arm into the bedroom, while the maid stands gaping at what the Guest has done to her master and mistress. In his libretto Svend Leopold stays loyal to the characterization and chronology of Pontoppidan's story, but chooses to tie a cute ribbon around the tale by allowing the couple's disagreement to be resolved by love. In Pontoppidan's original, however, the evening ends in bitter jealousy, and the last half of the story deals with the highly problematical after-effects of the visit. The restlessness and the rich emotional life that the Guest brings into the home are very much a two-edged sword. But in Børresen's interpretation the positive effects are by far the strongest.

      "description": "The Piksels and Lines Orchestra is an experimental performance system for graphic design. The image industry populates our visual culture, yet it exists in a world with an inner life that is invisible to most people. The orchestra shifts the focus from the end results to the actions and decisions that take place during the creative process. By turning the tools of graphic design, the software applications, into instruments, the active labour and the operational gestures of designers are converted to sound. Actions like painting, cutting, setting text, adding layers, drawing shapes etc. are reflected by sonic events within a score. At the same time, the system brings the audience visually into the everyday work environment of the designer by exposing the application interfaces as they are used. In order to make the necessary software modifications, the applications used in this project are all free and open source software. The end goal is to produce a noise opera, combining elements of traditional narratives with computer music which illustrates and interrogates the technical and social systems that operate within the microcosm of graphic design. The Piksel and Lines Orchestra is the response to an open call for an artist and one developer to work together to explore the performative and collaboritve aspects of free open source graphical software. The commissioned work is carried out by media artist Brendan Howell and software developer Jon Nordby, initiated by a residency supported by Piksel and USF AIR. A technical demonstration of the system will be presented at the Piksel [X] festival on the 24th November 2012. The final performance will be given at the LGRU Future Tools conference in Madrid April 2013. The project is hosted by Piksel as part of the EU-funded LGRU-project, and is supported by USF AIR, Bergen City Council and The Norwegian Art Council. http://www.piksel.no/pulse/plo",

      "description": "●▬▬▬▬▬ஜ❤️🤍💚ENGLISH❤️🤍💚ஜ▬▬▬▬▬● The Song of the Soviet Army (Russian: Песня о Советской Армии, tr. Pesnya o Sovetskoj Armii) or Invincible and Legendary (Несокрушимая и легендарная) or known recently as Song of the Russian Army (Russian: Песня о Российской Армии, tr. Pesnya o Rossiskoj Armii) is a famous World War II song written and performed at the war's end. Its performance was done by numerous artists, including the Alexandrov Ensemble. The original 1945 is highly triumphal with its brass fanfares and ecstatic chords extended upward with the aid of trumpets, as part of the V-E Day celebrations. That arrangement by A. Alexandrov is very much in the tradition of final choruses in 19th-century Italian grand opera, and shows how he originally envisaged this composition. There are many versions of the song. This song also serves as the official song of the Russian Armed Forces today. ●▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ❤️🤍💚RUSSIAN❤️🤍💚ஜ▬▬▬▬▬● «Несокрушимая и легендарная» — советская песня, созданная в годы Великой Отечественной войны композитором Александром Александровым на слова Осипа Колычева; также называется «Песня о Советской армии». Была создана к 25-летнему юбилею Красной армии[1] и впервые прозвучала с киноэкрана в феврале 1943 года в фильме-концерте, снятом по заданию Советского правительства к 25-летию Красной армии режиссёрами С. Герасимовым, М. Калатозовым и Е. Дзиганом. Исполнялась многими певцами и музыкальными коллективами. Была записана на грампластинках Апрелевским заводом. Ею открывались выпуски советской телевизионной передачи «Служу Советскому Союзу». Песня является визитной карточкой Академического дважды Краснознамённого, ордена Красной Звезды ансамбля песни и пляски Российской Армии имени А. В. Александрова, который традиционно открывает ей все свои выступления. ●▬▬▬▬▬ஜ❤️❤️❤️CREDITS❤️❤️❤️ஜ▬▬▬▬▬● This video was made in collaboration with Szegedi Attila, \"Damimani\" and David Cseperkáló, who kindly helped me with the lyrics of the video.

The lecture is open to the public without charge.\\r \\r Helen and Hard was founded in 1996 in Stavanger on the west coast of Norway by architects Siv Helene Stangeland and Reinhard Kropf. Today, the company has a youthful staff of 18 drawn from different countries. The firm works with a wide spectrum of projects from interior, design, art and architecture to town planning.\\r \\r Helen and Hard's work attempts to creatively engage with sustainability, moving away from a solely technical or anthropocentric view towards a synergistic mode, which allows for an extended confluence not only with humans but also with contextual and material resources. Far from passive ingredients, they have a space-generating capacity as active participants in the design process. This requires a communicative engagement and synergistic collaboration with particular, local and global resources and knowledge fields. During the design process, they are synthesized in between empirical and experimental sequences, and woven together into architecture.\\r \\r Helen and Hard's work explores the heterogenic nature of relational space, not as a post-modern narrative collage, but as a fine weave, a field of interrelated sensitive elements, responding to its surrounding environment. This evocative and interwoven space expresses to the user potentiality for interaction and sharpening of all senses. The endeavor is to create meeting spaces accommodating both shared social and individual meditative encounter.\\r \\r Siv Helene Stangeland was born in Stavanger, Norway. She studied at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design and at the School of Architecture of Barcelona, Spain. She has taught at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology at Trondheim, at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, and at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Reinhard Kropf was born in Austria and studied at the Austria University of Technology in Graz and the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. He has taught at the Ecole Speciale díArchitecture in Paris and at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design.\\r \\r The firm has received many awards and honors, including the Norwegian National Award for Good Building and Environmental Design for the Pulpit Rock Mountain Lodge in Norway, nomination as an up and coming architect in Wallpaperis 10-Year Jubilee issue, second prize for the Norwegian Pavilion among all Category 2 Pavilions at Expo Shanghai, and selection as one of eight European firms exhibited in îNew Trends of Architectureî, Tokyo, 2008. The firm also won first prize in the following competitions: Cultural House and Library in Venessla, 2009; Norwegian Pavilion, Expo Shanghai, 2008; Experience Center at Floien, Bergen, 2007; Cultural House at Flekkefjord, 2007; and New Hotel at Pulpit Rock, 2005. The firm's work has been exhibited at the Lisbon Triennale, Lisbon, 2010; Building Blocks, Stockholm, 2010; Nordic Models + Common Ground, New York City, 2010; 1:1 Architects Build Small Spaces, V&A, London, 2010, Nordic Landscapes, Shanghai, 2010; Venezia Biennale, Italy, 2008 and 2010; and New Trends in Architecture, Tokyo, Perth, Istanbul, 2008-2010.\\r \\r The Victor L. Regnier Visiting Faculty Chair in Architecture at Kansas State University, funded by the Victor and Helen Regnier Family Foundation of Mission, Kansas, was established in 2003 through the extraordinary generosity of his children, Victor A. Regnier, Robert D. Regnier, and Catherine M. Regnier, who sought to enrich the educational experience of Kansas State University architecture students by exposing them to the finest architects from around the world.\\r \\r Attendance at any CAPD-sponsored lecture can be submitted as continuing education credit by design professionals by contacting Diane Potts.\\r \\r For more information, contact:\\r Peter Magyar, 785.532.5953\\r Torgeir Norheim, 785.532.5953",

(The pilot for this ultimately 12-episode show was broadcast on May 10th 1976.) Ben Murphy played the title role, a man who has a watch that makes him invisible if pressed, but can only be invisible 15 minutes at a time or else he will vanish forever; also co-starred Katherine Crawford and William Sylvester. This episode - involving the transport of very dangerous fuel - featured among the guest stars Jim Stafford (of \"Spiders and Snakes\" and \"My Girl Bill\" fame). A mini-bonus will follow. Also of significance, later on that night, the first of three Presidential debates between Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter would be held. 😄 Fuzzy's Note: I would be remiss if I did not also mention that this episode of Gemini Man comprises a good portion of my favorite Mystery Science Theatre 3000 episode of all time - \"Riding with Death\".

      "description": "Edvard Grieg, Suite Holberg - Gerhard Oppitz, Herbert von Karajan Qui riuniti i seguenti due video: (00:00) - Edvard Grieg - Holberg Suite (Piano), op. 40 [With score],  Damon J.H.K. ,  30 ago 2020,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCvE1HPEcoU \"-Composer: Edvard Hagerup Grieg (15 June 1843 – 4 September 1907) -Performer: Gerhard Oppitz Fra Holbergs tid {From Holberg's Time} or \"Holberg Suite\" for Piano, op. 40, written in 1884 I. Praeludium II. Sarabande III. Gavotte IV. Air V. Rigaudon Despite the fact that Ludvig Holberg (1684 - 1754) lived most of his life in Denmark and was considered the father of Danish literature, his birthplace was Bergen, Norway, and for the bicentenary of his birth, Norwegians celebrated heartily. Even as a resident of Denmark, Holberg recalled in his works his childhood and celebrated the time that he spent there. Made a baron in 1747, his was an imposing reputation. Educated at the universities of Copenhagen and Oxford, Holberg's writings are regarded as having established Danish as a literary language. Prior to his time, Danish was employed only in ballads and hymns; plays were presented in French or German. Besides more than a dozen successful plays (several of them comedies), he wrote a history of his adopted country and published a collection of philosophical treatises. Notwithstanding his stronger relationship to Denmark, Norwegians were pleased to acknowledge Holberg, and Grieg, also a Bergen native, was one of those who directed the planning for the event. As early as 1878, he contributed a fee from his publisher to the erecting of a Holberg statue in Bergen. Further, he wrote two works, the first for male voices, a Cantata for the Unveiling of the Holberg Memorial, and a second (of more lasting consequence) entitled From Holberg's Time: Suite in Olden Style. Grieg himself, a more than capable pianist, premiered the piano suite just days after the dedication of the memorial. Its great success led Grieg to score it for string orchestra the following year. Both versions enjoy enduring popularity. The suite in five sections was intended by Grieg to recall the dance suites from Holberg's lifetime, which corresponded to the period of the Baroque. The Praeludium which opens the work is a section of such simple radiance that it imprints itself unforgettably on the listener's consciousness. The contrasting Sarabande moves soberly, reflectively, and with unfailing elegance. The Gavotte which forms the third section trips beguilingly over the course of its three minutes, yielding to the Andante religioso tempo of the Aria. The final section, a Rigaudon, returns the listener to the buoyant mood of the beginning prelude. Through each of the five sections, the level of invention is matched by a refinement and purity of feeling that marks this as among the most cherishable short works of the late nineteenth century.

      "description": "Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra：WAGNER – Parsifal A young man ignorant of everything, including his own name, arrives at the Kingdom of the Holy Grail. Is he the ‘pure fool, enlightened by compassion’, who, it has been prophesied, will purify the realm? Live from Bergen for a concert staging of Parsifal, Richard Wagner’s final music drama which is unlike anything that went before or has come since. It can feel more like a ritual ceremony than an opera – grand yet intimate, somehow occupying its own space and time. At the heart of Parsifal is a curious, magical treatment of the symphony orchestra that appears to give the voices above it all the space and autonomy they need. Following award-winning concert performances of Peter Grimes with Stuart Skelton in the title role, the Australian tenor returns to Bergen in the same capacity for this Parsifal under chief conductor Edward Gardner. Joining them is a fine cast including Johan Reuter as the wounded Amfortas, Brindley Sherratt as the wise old Gurnemanz and Ricarda Merbeth as the teasing Kundry. THE STORY Act I In the Pyrenees, the old Knight Titurel lives in the Castle of Montsalvat where the Grail is held. His son, Amfortas, had been injured by the magician Klingsor, enemy of the Knights of the Grail, by his own Holy Spear, the arm that injured the Christ. Amfortas can only be healed by the contact with this Spear. In the forest, around the castle, the Knight Gurnemanz and his two knaves meet Kundry, messenger of the knights of the Grail to whom Klingsor cast an evil spell. She brings a balsam from Arabia to cure the king. He accepts but it has been said that only 'an innocent with a pure heart' would be able to get the Lance back and cure him. A young man, guilty of having killed one of the sacred swans of Montsalvat, is brought in by a troop of warriors. It’s Parsifal, a young wandering knight, who seems to know nothing about his origins. Act II At the Castle of Klingsor, the latter asks Kundry to entice Parsifal to make him sin, so that he can retrieve the Holy Grail. Klingsor then transforms his castle into a beautiful garden where young girls in bloom use their charm to seduce Parsifal, in vain. Only Kundry is able to do so. As he realises that he has sinned, Parsifal composes himself and cries out his pain. Upset, Kundry understands she has to break Klingsor’s enchantment and look for redemption in Parsifal’s love. But Kundry is rejected by him, so she decides to call Klingsor who cast the Holy Spear. Parsifal seizes it, makes the sign of the cross: Klingsor and his castle get destroyed and Kundry faints. Act III Gurnemanz lives as a hermit not far from the mountain of Grail. Kundry visits him, asking him to serve again the Knights of the Grail when suddenly, a black-armored knight arrives: it’s Parsifal. Gurnemanz understands he is the 'innocent with a pure heart' and crown him king of Grail and baptizes Kundry. Back to the castle of Grail, Parsifal heals Amfortas by touching him with the Holy Spear. Eventually forgiven, Kundry dies.

      "description": "Care, Cure, Corruption Series An Enemy of the People By Henrik Ibsen Jane Page, Director April 30 – May 8, 2016 Little Theatre The future is looking bright in Dr. Stockmann's hometown on the coast of southern Norway. At his urging, the town has built therapeutic Baths, which will invite tourists and their dollars. However, trouble arrives when the Doctor discovers that the water of the Baths is teeming with bacteria, guaranteed to make everyone sick. Ridiculed and persecuted by the townsfolk for his honesty, he is declared an \"enemy of the people.\" This classic Ibsen text explores the intersection of standing alone to tell an uncomfortable truth versus bowing to the corruption of a complacent majority. It also questions whether there is even such a thing as absolute truth; in Ibsen’s words, \"A normally constituted truth lives—let us say—as a rule, seventeen or eighteen years, at the outside twenty, very seldom more. And truths so patriarchal as that are always shockingly emaciated.

Skuespillet er formet som en samtale hvor de leser opp hverandres brev, og var en stor suksess på Nationaltheatret. I rollene medvirker Lillebil Ibsen (Mrs. Campbell) og Per Aabel (George Bernard Shaw). Oversatt av Axel Kielland. Dekor: Erik Hagen. Instruktør: Gerda Ring. Fjernsynsregi: Sølve Kern.
