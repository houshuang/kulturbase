    "notes": "Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 4 is not directly based on a specific literary work like a play, novel, or poem. However, Tchaikovsky described a detailed 'program' or emotional narrative for the symphony in letters to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, explaining the meaning and emotions behind each movement. The symphony explores themes of fate, struggle, melancholy, and fleeting happiness. The opening fanfare represents fate, and the symphony can be interpreted as Tchaikovsky's reflection on his own life and emotional state."

    "notes": "Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 is not directly based on a specific literary work like a play, novel, or poem. However, Tchaikovsky considered an 'unspoken program' related to fate and resignation when composing the symphony. He sketched a scenario for the first movement involving 'complete resignation before Fate'. This theme of fate is reflected in the recurring 'fate motif' throughout the symphony. While the symphony explores these themes, it doesn't adapt a particular literary source."

    "notes": "While Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, also known as the Pathétique, isn't directly based on a specific literary work, it is believed to reflect on themes of life, passion, disappointment, and death. Tchaikovsky himself mentioned a program for the symphony but chose not to reveal it, suggesting it was meant to be an enigma for listeners to interpret. Some sources mention a cryptic note found among his sketches that outlines a program: 'The ultimate essence … of the symphony is Life. First part – all impulse, passion, confidence, thirst for activity. Must be short (the finale death – result of collapse). Second part love: third disappointments; fourth ends dying away (also short)'. However, it is not confirmed if this program was fully realized in the final version of the symphony."
