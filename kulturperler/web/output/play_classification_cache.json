    "reasoning": "The title suggests a 'technothriller' which fits the genre of dramatic work written for radio or TV. The episode count of 3 is low, ruling out 'dramaserie'. While the author is named, 'James Follett' is not one of the famous playwrights, and lack of a Sceneweb URL supports it not being a traditionally staged play. Therefore, it is most likely a drama written for NRK.",
